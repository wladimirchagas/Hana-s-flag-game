# Subnational flag audit — 2026-09

Ledger for the September 2026 audit of every **state/province-level flag** (Learn-mode
subdivision cards, the sub-national flag game) and **capital-city flag** ("View capital") the app
shows. It records what was wrong, what it is now, the source that proves it, and the judgement
calls made, so a later reviewer can challenge any of them. Batches ship as separate PRs; each
section below says which batch fixed it.

**Joining the work?** Start with [the audit handbook](SUBNATIONAL_FLAG_AUDIT_HANDBOOK.md). It has
the goals, the method, the tools, the current status and the queue of open items to claim.

## Method

Nothing was changed from memory. Every decision below rests on at least one of these sources,
fetched during the audit:

| Source | How it was used |
|---|---|
| **Wikidata** `P41` (flag image) of the item whose `P300` is the ISO 3166-2 code | One SPARQL pull for all 6,097 ISO 3166-2 items (with rank and start/end qualifiers). The app code is mapped through `scripts/data/wikidata-subdivision-code-aliases.mjs`. |
| **Wikimedia Commons** file pages | The description page of each reference file was read to catch `{{fictitious flag}}`, `{{proposed flag}}` and "own work, no source" drawings. |
| **Flags of the World** (FOTW, crwflags.com) | Country indexes and per-subdivision pages. This is the only source for whether a flag exists at all, and it says so explicitly ("There is no known flag for the province…"). |
| **Local-language Wikipedia infoboxes** (`bandera`, `Bandiera`, `image_flag`) | es/it/en/uk/ja/zh/pt articles for the subdivision itself, not its capital. |
| Official sites where cited (e.g. mk-oblrada.gov.ua for Mykolaiv) | For recent adoptions. |

Automated passes (scripts in the audit scratchpad, not shipped):

1. **Inventory**: for all 4,182 divisions in 204 countries, which file is shown and where it comes from (curated override, bundled file, runtime CDN, suppressed, none).
2. **Perceptual comparison** of every shown flag with the Wikidata reference (a mean colour distance on a 24×16 grid, plus a 576-bit dHash). Every pair beyond a small tolerance was montage-reviewed by eye: 132 pairs.
3. **Capital-city comparison**: every province flag was compared with its own capital's bundled city flag. This caught provinces that were showing their **capital city's** flag.
4. **Unbacked set**: the 235 shown flags with no Wikidata backing were montage-reviewed country by country and checked against FOTW and Wikipedia.
5. **Name/code check**: each division's app name against the Wikidata label of its ISO code. This caught mis-coded divisions (Posavina, Moscow).
6. **Recent-change scan**: Wikidata flags with start dates since 2018, plus the known 2024 US changes (Minnesota and Utah are correct).

## Batch 1 — wrong flags removed or replaced, bundling fixed

### 1. Flags that were not the subdivision's own flag — now suppressed (91 codes)

A missing flag beats a wrong one (CLAUDE.md). Every bundled file below was **deleted**, and every
code is in `SUPPRESSED_SUBDIVISION_FLAGS` with a one-line reason. The new
`check-subdivision-flags-bundled.mjs` fails the build if a suppressed code keeps a file.

| Class | Codes | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Parent (national) flag** | AE-FU Fujairah (UAE flag) | Fujairah has flown the UAE flag since 1975; its red emirate flag is historical (FOTW ae-fu). |
| **Invented / fictitious** | ZM-01…10 (all 10 Zambian provinces) | FOTW's Zambia index (modified 2025-09-27) lists **no** provincial flags, only five city flags and two traditional ones. Wikidata has none either. |
| | SO-BK Bakool, SO-GE Gedo, SO-BR Bari, SO-SH Lower Shabelle, SO-BY Bay | FOTW documents only the Banaadir region flag (kept: it matches) and member-state flags. FOTW's own Bari (2012) and Gedo flags are different designs from ours. |
| | GH-AA Greater Accra, GH-TV Volta, GH-EP Eastern | Ghana's regions have no flags (FOTW gh.html). The GH-EP source is tagged `{{fictitious flag}}` on Commons, and the Greater Accra file is a 2022 "own work". |
| | GH-AH Ashanti | The image is the **Asante people's** traditional flag (FOTW gh_asa, Commons "flags of ethnic groups"), not the Ashanti Region's. |
| | ZA-EC, ZA-NC, ZA-NW, ZA-WC | Only **Mpumalanga** has a provincial flag (FOTW za-.html). The Commons files are 2011 user drawings, tagged `{{fictitious flag}}`. |
| | CR-SJ San José (CR) | "San José didn't adopt a flag yet… was used for short time some years ago" (FOTW cr-sj). The Commons file is tagged `{{proposed flag}}`. |
| **Coat of arms / seal / logo / text shown as a flag** | ZA-LP Limpopo, ZA-NL KwaZulu-Natal, ZA-GT Gauteng | Coats of arms on white. KZN's "local flag" is only a SAVA proposal; Gauteng's white logo flag is a government house flag, "not considered the flag of the province" (FOTW). |
| | RO-MH, RO-CT, RO-OT, RO-SV, RO-IF, RO-AG, RO-BZ, RO-BV, RO-SB, RO-B, RO-SM | Arms only. FOTW: "No information is available on flag" for each county. |
| | RO-TM Timiș, RO-HD Hunedoara | Arms-and-lettering logos; no documented flag. |
| | RO-CS Caraș-Severin | Its real flag is blue with the arms and name (FOTW); the file was the bare arms. |
| | NG-KT Katsina | The word "KATSINA" on white. en.wikipedia: *"Please do not add a flag here without a reliable source."* |
| | NG-KE Kebbi (map silhouette), NG-FC FCT ("Abuja — The Heart of Nigeria" brand), NG-EB Ebonyi (the state seal), NG-BA Bauchi, NG-KD Kaduna | No flag in FOTW, the en.wikipedia infobox or Commons "Flags of states of Nigeria". |
| | CU-14 Guantánamo | **The seal of the US Naval Base, Guantánamo Bay.** Cuban provinces have no flags (FOTW cu-.html; es.wikipedia "bandera = no"). |
| | CU-11 Holguín | The "San Isidoro de Holguín" municipal logo. |
| | DO-05 Dajabón ("Ayuntamiento Municipal" logo), DO-02 Azua (a shield), DO-31 San José de Ocoa (an emblem) | Not flags. |
| | TT-DMN Diego Martin, TT-PRT Princes Town, TT-RCM Mayaro–Rio Claro | Corporation badges/logos; the en.wikipedia infobox flag is empty. |
| | UY-MO Montevideo (black-and-white arms drawing), UY-TA Tacuarembó (logo) | No departmental flag in the es.wikipedia infobox. |
| | NI-SJ Río San Juan | A municipal "Alcaldía" logo. |
| **A capital CITY's flag standing in for the province** (Portugal-district rule) | CU-06 Cienfuegos | es.wikipedia: the province has no flag; this is the city's. |
| | ES-ZA Zamora (the city's *Seña Bermeja*), ES-V Valencia (the Valencian *senyera*), ES-TF Santa Cruz de Tenerife (Tenerife **island**'s flag) | es.wikipedia: none of the three provinces has a flag. |
| | IT-CT Catania, IT-PT Pistoia, IT-FG Foggia, IT-BG Bergamo, IT-ME Messina | Each file was the capital city's flag. The province has only a gonfalone, or no clean flag image exists (Bergamo's only image is a drawing on a pole; Messina's is a 2025 drawing with no blazon). |
| | IT-AG Agrigento, IT-MC Macerata, IT-AP Ascoli Piceno, IT-VI Vicenza | Arms-on-white images. it.wikipedia shows only a gonfalone for each province. |
| | NI-BO, NI-CA, NI-CI, NI-CO, NI-ES, NI-GR, NI-LE, NI-MD, NI-MN, NI-MS, NI-MT, NI-NS, NI-RI (all 13 Nicaraguan departments) | Nicaragua's departments have no elected government or flag. Every image was the capital municipality's flag: Managua's reads *"Ciudad de Managua"*, and Wikidata files Carazo and Chontales under **Jinotepe** and **Juigalpa**. The two autonomous regions (NI-AN, NI-AS) keep their flags. |
| **No known flag** | DO-10 Independencia, DO-09 Espaillat, DO-32 Santo Domingo | FOTW: "There is no known flag for the province of …" |
| | DO-15 Monte Cristi, DO-13 La Vega, DO-24 Sánchez Ramírez | No FOTW page, no es.wikipedia `bandera`. |

The explainers that described these images were removed from `flagMeanings.ts`: 18 entries
(ZA-EC/NC/NW/WC/LP, RO-CT, ES-V, IT-CT/PT/FG/AG/MC/AP/VI/BG/ME, AE-FU and NI-MT), plus the
Republika Srpska explainer, BA-SRP, removed with Posavina's fix (§4). The panel renders the
explainer even when no flag is shown, so each would otherwise have described a missing flag.

**Kept with a label.** ZA-FS Free State shows its coat of arms on white, marked *"Flag not
officially recognised by South Africa"*. FOTW za-fs (Bruce Berry, 2 Jan 2022) records that exactly
that flag is flown at the provincial legislature and at public events.

### 2. Wrong images replaced with the subdivision's real flag (10 codes)

Several of these had an explainer that already described the **correct** flag while the image
was wrong. The previous meaning sweep had read the right sources, but nobody replaced the file.

| Code | Was | Now (Wikimedia Commons) |
|---|---|---|
| CH-AR Appenzell Ausserrhoden | The **shield** of the coat of arms (0.82:1) | The square cantonal flag, `Flag of Canton of Appenzell Ausserrhoden.svg` |
| AU-WA Western Australia | A Blue Ensign with a **St Edward's Crown above the swan badge**, which is not the state flag | `Flag of Western Australia.svg`: the 1953 state flag, with no crown |
| UA-48 Mykolaiv Oblast | The 2001 flag (mitre on crossed crosiers) | The **2026** flag adopted by oblast council decision No. 5 of 16 April 2026 (mk-oblrada.gov.ua), `Flag of Mykolaiv Oblast (2026).svg` |
| JP-12 Chiba | Field in dark indigo `#1a15a3` | 空色 sky blue as set by the 1963 prefectural notice No. 328-2, `Flag of Chiba Prefecture.svg` |
| IT-CO Como | The **city**'s red flag with a white cross | The provincial flag, `Provincia di Como-Bandiera.svg` |
| IT-AN Ancona | The **city**'s red flag with a gold cross | The provincial flag, `Provincia di Ancona-Bandiera.svg` |
| IT-LC Lecco | The **city**'s arms on blue | The provincial flag, `Provincia di Lecco-Bandiera.svg` |
| ES-A Alicante | The **city** arms (A-L-L-A) | The provincial flag, `Alicante (provincia).svg` |
| ES-TO Toledo | The **city**'s crimson flag with the imperial eagle | The Diputación's green flag, `Bandera de la provincia de Toledo.svg` |
| PH-ILI Iloilo | The bare seal (a square image) | The provincial flag (the seal on white, 2:1), `Flag of the Province of Iloilo.svg` |

Large or viewBox-less SVGs were bundled as Wikimedia's own 1280 px PNG renders. Sources are recorded
in `public/flags/sources.json`.

**Checked and deliberately not changed:** IT-PC Piacenza. The province's own flag *is* red with a
white square (`Flag of the province of Piacenza.svg`), the same symbol as the city's. Wikidata's
`P41` points at a blue "(Variant)" file.

### 3. Bundling: no more runtime CDN (≈350 flags)

`src/lib/subdivisionFlagIndex.ts` listed only part of the bundled files as local. The rest,
**356 flags** were fetched at runtime from a CDN. They included 31 US states plus the Northern
Mariana Islands (California, New York, Massachusetts…), 59 Italian provinces (Rome, Lucca…), 42
Thai provinces, 36 Spanish provinces, 31 Hungarian counties, 23 Mexican states and 18 Russian
regions. The CDN was
`cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/amckenna41/iso3166-flags`. During this audit jsDelivr answered **403/404 for
46 of them** in one pass, which leaves those cards blank for users. **348 of the 356 files were
already in the repo** (347 byte-identical). The index now lists every bundled file and has **no CDN
fallback**, and the 8 files that were missing were bundled (NI-MN was then suppressed). The new
`scripts/check-subdivision-flags-bundled.mjs` (in `flags:check` and the `flag-integrity` CI job)
fails the build if:

- an indexed code has no file;
- a bundled file is unreferenced;
- a suppressed code keeps a file;
- a file's bytes don't match its extension;
- any remote URL appears.

The check also found:
- **PT-01…PT-07** (city gonfalons "Cidade de Beja", "Cidade de Coimbra"…) were still bundled and
  indexed. The earlier Portugal ruling said they had been deleted; they now are.
- **LV-102.png** was a WebP file with a `.png` name. It was converted to a real PNG, with pixels
  unchanged.

### 4. Mis-coded subdivisions (the whole data chain was wrong, not just the flag)

| Division | Problem | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **Posavina Canton** (Bosnia and Herzegovina) | Natural Earth gives the canton **Republika Srpska's ISO code BA-SRP**. The Croat-majority Federation canton therefore showed: the **Republika Srpska flag**; its explainer; "Република Српска" as local name; RS's population, **1,228,423** (the canton has ~43,000); **Sarajevo** as capital (seat: Orašje); and Sarajevo's city flag. A previous sweep had noticed the mismatch in `capital-meaning-omitted.txt` but left it. | `public/subdivisions/BA.json` drops the code. The canton is now keyed by name like its nine sibling cantons. All BA-SRP rows were removed (population, capital, endonyms, capital flag, explainer). |
| **Moscow / Moscow Oblast** | Natural Earth **swapped** RU-MOW and RU-MOS. A meta name override hid it by renaming. So the **city** card showed the oblast's population (8.59 M), "Московская" as local name and **Krasnogorsk** as its capital; the **oblast** card showed the city's 13.27 M. | Codes swapped back in `RU.json`, override corrected. `cities.ts`, `nationalCapitalLocations.ts` and meta were regenerated. Krasnogorsk was added as the oblast's capital marker (a Wikidata fallback, applied surgically; a full regeneration of that file drags in unrelated drift). |
| **Spain's 43 provinces** | Natural Earth tags every province with its community's type, so all 50 cards said "Autonomous Community". | Typed "Province" (ISO 3166-2:ES). The 7 single-province communities and the 2 autonomous cities keep their labels. |

### 5. Knock-on fixes

- `sharedCapitalFlags.ts` was regenerated. A capital flag had been hidden as a "duplicate" of the
  city flag the province was wrongly showing (Como, Ancona, Catania, Bergamo, Messina, Cienfuegos,
  Holguín, the Nicaraguan capitals…). Those city flags now show in "View capital", where they
  belong. The generator no longer folds in a curated pair whose subdivision flag is suppressed or
  gone. **SV-AH** (Ahuachapán ≡ its capital) had silently gone stale (distance 24, not 8), so it is
  now curated.
- `subdiv-remaining.mjs` now counts curated `LOCAL_FLAG_OVERRIDES` too. This surfaced **35
  displayed flags with no explainer**: Jersey, Guernsey, Gibraltar, the Faroes, Åland, Cook
  Islands and others. See the follow-ups below.

## Batch 2 — Malaysia (owner priority, 2026-09-26)

Every flag the app shows for Malaysia was checked: the 13 state and 3 federal-territory flags, all
capital-city flags, and every explainer against its cited source.

**State and territory flags — all correct.** All 16 match Wikidata `P41` and the Commons originals
side by side, and the 14 existing explainers match their cited articles, including the adoption
dates: Negeri Sembilan 1895, Pahang 1903, Perak 1879, Malacca 16 July 1957, and Sabah and Sarawak
1988.

**Two missing explainers added.** Labuan and Putrajaya had been logged as unsourceable. The log
cited FOTW pages `my-labuan` and `my-putrajaya`, which are guessed filenames that 404. FOTW's Malaysia
index (`my_index.html`) links the real pages, `my-labua.html` and `my-pj.html`.
- Labuan: the colour and emblem symbolism is from the Malay Wikipedia article
  [Identiti, Bendera dan jata Labuan](https://ms.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identiti,_Bendera_dan_jata_Labuan).
  The adoption year is left out: sources disagree (1984 on ms.wikipedia, 31 August 1992 on
  en.wikipedia).
- Putrajaya: the flag was adopted 1 February 2001, and the national arms mark the territory as the
  federal administrative centre ([Identiti Putrajaya](https://ms.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identiti_Putrajaya)).
  Colour meanings circulate for this flag, but their primary source is the Information Department
  booklet *Mari Kenali Bendera Negeri-Negeri di Malaysia*. `dbook.penerangan.gov.my` could not be
  reached, so they are not used.

**Capital-city flags — two showed a different entity's flag.**

| Capital | Was | Evidence | Now |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Seremban** (MY-05) | `Flag of Sungei Ujong.svg` — the flag of **Sungai Ujong**, one of the nine traditional chiefdoms (*luak*) of Negeri Sembilan | FOTW [my-n-su](https://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/my-n-su.html) ("quartered black, yellow, white and green") vs [my-05-se](https://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/my-05-se.html) | The **Seremban City Council** flag: yellow–black–red with the council emblem, city since 1 Jan 2020. en.wikipedia `Flag of Seremban.png` (PD-Malaysia), identical to FOTW's image. New explainer from the council's own [logo page](https://www.mbs.gov.my/ms/mbs/profil/logo) |
| **Kuala Terengganu** (MY-11) | `Flag of Kuala Terengganu, Terengganu.svg` — the **district** flag (yellow with the state flag in the canton) | The Commons file page says "a district in Terengganu", and FOTW [my-ter-m](https://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/my-ter-m.html) lists it among the district flags. It gives the Kuala Terengganu City Council (MBKT) flag separately | **No flag**. MBKT's flag has no free file on Commons or en.wikipedia; its explainer is removed |

Both rejections are recorded with their evidence in the new `scripts/data/capital-flag-rejected.json`.
`build-capital-details.mjs` drops these entries on every regen, and `backfill-capital-flags.mjs` never
proposes them. `check-capital-flags.mjs` fails the build if either is back in the manifest. A
wrong-entity flag can therefore not return through the Wikidata pass, an override or a preserved
manifest entry.

**Explainers corrected.**
- Kota Kinabalu (MY-12) had given its flag the colour meanings of Sabah's **1963 state flag**, which
  no source ties to the city flag. It now says only what FOTW documents: Mount Kinabalu was chosen to
  represent Sabah's capital, and the flag was first raised at midnight on 1 February 2000, when the
  city was proclaimed.
- Putrajaya's capital-city entry had given the flag the colour meanings of the 2006 combined
  **Federal Territories flag**, a different flag. It is now aligned with the subdivision entry. The
  capital widget hides this flag anyway, because it duplicates the territory's.

**Omission logs cleaned.** Seremban's entry had described the chiefdom flag as the "MBS council
flag". Shah Alam's was stale: its flag and explainer have displayed since the Klang/Shah Alam fix.

**Gaps that stay open, with reasons.**
- No free file exists for the city-council flags of Kota Bharu, Kuantan (city since 21 Feb 2021),
  Kangar, Kuching (Kuching North City Hall and Kuching South City Council are separate councils) or
  Kuala Terengganu. FOTW documents all of them except Kota Bharu. Commons holds only the Kota Bharu
  **district** flag, an unsourced 2015 "own work", which is not used.
- The population of Labuan's capital, Victoria, is still a 2000 estimate. DOSM publishes no
  newer figure for the town, only for the whole territory (95,120 in the 2020 census).

## Batch 3 — South Korea (owner priority, 2026-09-26)

I checked the 17 first-level divisions against Wikidata `P41`, the Korean Wikipedia infoboxes and
the dedicated flag articles (`…기`), and every capital-city flag against its city's Korean Wikipedia
infobox.

**The 15 bundled flags are current.** Each matches its Commons original, including the new flags
of Gangwon State (June 2023), North Chungcheong (October 2023) and Jeonbuk State (January 2024).
Their explainers already describe those new flags.

**Seoul and Busan now have flags.** Both had none.
- **Seoul**: the 1996 flag. The logo's 서울 is drawn as a green mountain, a red sun and the blue
  Han River.
- **Busan**: the new flag adopted on 17 May 2023, which replaced the blue 1995 flag.

Both explainers come from Korean Wikipedia's flag articles
([서울특별시기](https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/서울특별시기),
[부산광역시기](https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/부산광역시기)).

**A district's flag was standing in for Seoul and Busan.** Both are city-territories, so the
Flag Master sub-national game falls back to the capital-city flag. Wikidata's `P36` for Seoul is
**Jung District**, where City Hall stands, and for Busan it is **Yeonje District**.
- The game therefore showed the Jung-gu and Yeonje-gu district flags as "Seoul's" and "Busan's"
  flags.
- The capital widget printed "Capital: Seoul — Local name: 중구" (Jung-gu) and "…연제구".

The fix:
- The seat district's name, population, endonym and flag are removed.
- `SEAT_DISTRICT_NOT_A_CAPITAL` in `build-capital-details.mjs` keeps them out on regen.
- Both flags are added to `capital-flag-rejected.json`.

**Types and plural label.** Natural Earth's `type_en` had called **South Jeolla** and
**North Gyeongsang** "Metropolitan City", and Seoul a "Capital Metropolitan City". The plural label
read "Metropolitan Citys". The types now follow ISO 3166-2:KR and Korean law:
- Seoul: Special City;
- Busan, Daegu, Incheon, Gwangju, Daejeon and Ulsan: Metropolitan City;
- the six ordinary provinces: Province;
- Gangwon (2023), Jeonbuk (2024) and Jeju (2006): Special Self-Governing Province;
- Sejong: Special Self-Governing City.

The label is now "Provinces & Metropolitan Cities".

**Three capital populations were wrong.** Each is replaced with the authority's own
resident-registration count for Korean nationals at the end of August 2026, in
`CAPITAL_POPULATION_OVERRIDES`.

| Capital | Was (Wikidata) | Problem | Now |
|---|---|---|---|
| Jeonju | 341,545 (2023) | about half the city | 618,908 ([Jeonju City](https://www.jeonju.go.kr/index.9is?contentUid=ff8080818990c349018b041a9f093a72)) |
| Jeju City | 698,358 (2024) | the whole province's figure, larger than the province's own count | 484,149 ([Jeju Statistics Portal](https://www.jeju.go.kr/stats/stats/population.htm)) |
| Chuncheon | 281,596 (2015) | eleven years stale | 284,783 ([Chuncheon City](https://www.chuncheon.go.kr/cityhall/administrative-info/municipal-info/resident-registration-population-status/)) |

**Still open.**
- Muan County has no population. The county publishes it only as a session-bound spreadsheet.
- Jeju City has no free flag file.
- South Korea's 2025 Population and Housing Census was released on 28 July 2026 and supersedes
  the mixed-year provincial figures (2018–2025) now shown. That is a population refresh for the
  whole country.

## Batch 4 — Czechia, Poland, Estonia (2026-09-26)

**41 real flags were bundled but never shown.** The files were named with the current ISO 3166-2
codes, while the app's maps use older ones:
- Poland: PL-02…PL-32 against the app's PL-DS…PL-ZP (16);
- Czechia: CZ-10…CZ-80 against CZ-PR…CZ-ZL (14);
- Estonia: the 2022 renumbering, e.g. EE-68 against EE-67 for Pärnu (11).

The files are renamed to the app's codes. Their `sources.json` keys move with them and keep their
original source URLs.

**Every file was checked against the current Commons original** (Wikidata `P41`), rendered in
Chromium. Two were out of date and are replaced from Commons:

| Code | Was | Now |
|---|---|---|
| CZ-ST Central Bohemia | St Wenceslas's eagle drawn without its flames | `Vlajka Středočeského kraje.svg` |
| PL-WP Greater Poland | older revision: the red hoist was 0.57 of the height instead of a square | `POL województwo wielkopolskie flag.svg` |

Świętokrzyskie's file is the current flag (adopted 28 December 2012), not the 2001–2013 one.
Opole's file has the 2:1 stripes its resolution sets. Polish Wikipedia's "5:2" is wrong.

**Explainers.** 43 entries, each checked against the sources named:
- 14 Czech regions, from the Czech Wikipedia "Symboly … kraje" articles.
- 14 Polish voivodeships, from the Polish Wikipedia flag and arms articles and FOTW.
  Kuyavia-Pomerania's comes from the voivodeship's own flag leaflet (archived). It explains why
  black, not white, is the bottom stripe.
- 15 Estonian counties, from the Estonian Wikipedia "… maakonna lipp" / "… maakonna vapp"
  articles and FOTW [ee-sub](https://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/ee-sub.html). Every county flag
  follows the pattern confirmed on 7 August 1939: white over green, with the county arms on the
  white.

Four existing Estonian explainers were wrong or incomplete:
- **Harju (EE-37)** called the flag "the county arms as a banner". It is white over green with
  the arms.
- **Viljandi (EE-84)** said the grain meant "agrarian character" and the eagle "sovereignty and
  authority". Its cited source says neither, so those claims are removed.
- **Hiiu (EE-39) and Saare (EE-74)** described only the arms, not the flag.

**Omitted, with sources recorded:** Łódzkie and Opolskie. FOTW, Polish Wikipedia and the
voivodeships' own pages give the design, date and designer only. Opole's 2004 resolution, read in
full, includes a justification with no symbolism.

**Map-overlay shapes were wrong for 23 flags.** `build-flag-aspect-ratios.mjs` read the first
`viewBox` anywhere in a file's first 2 KB. It also misread `width="2e3"` as 2 and ignored `pt`/`cm`
units. Examples:
- Roraima was recorded at 0.0014:1, East Riding and Hertfordshire at 0.0017:1, and Alsace at 42:1.
- Five Polish flags came out at 0.71:1. They keep Inkscape's A4 page (`viewBox="0 0 210 297"`)
  behind an 800×500 flag.

The builder now reads the root `<svg>` tag and prefers its absolute width and height, as browsers
do; the `viewBox` is the fallback. Chromium shows each of the 23 files painting its whole flag
across the width×height box. That includes Nepal's 1743 pennant, now 0.6759 rather than 0.8182.

**Saare County's type.** Natural Earth typed Saare "Novads" (Latvian for a municipality), so
Estonia's grid split into "County (14)" and "Municipality (1)". It is a county, as ISO 3166-2:EE
and the other 14 cards have it. There is now a type override in `build-subdivision-meta.mjs`.

**Prague is a city-territory.** Act No. 131/2000 Coll., §1(1), makes Prague the capital, a region
and a municipality at once. `CZ-PR` joins `CITY_TERRITORY_CODES`, so the capital quiz never asks
for "the capital of Prague".

## Batch 5 — Slovakia, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, the Netherlands, Comoros, Saint Helena, Russia (2026-09-26)

**16 real flags were missing and are now bundled from Commons.** Each file was compared with the
division's FOTW page before bundling.

| Code | Division | Commons file |

**No screen shows the Saint Helena territory's three parts yet.** The app opens sub-national views
for UN members only, and on the UK's map the whole territory is one card, GB-SH. Ascension's and
Tristan da Cunha's flags and explainers are bundled so the data is complete if a view is added.

**Saint Helena island (SH-HL) stays blank, on purpose.** The app already shows Saint Helena's flag
for the whole territory (`sh.svg`, both as GB-SH and as the SH parent). Showing it again on the
island's card would repeat the parent's flag on a division, which the parent-collision check exists
to stop.

**Explainers.** 16 new entries. Every flag's FOTW page is cited, plus:
- Slovakia: the Bratislava Self-Governing Region's own page on its arms, and SKsymbol's blazons.
  FOTW traces each Banská Bystrica quarter to a historical county.
- Switzerland: the German Wikipedia "Wappen des Kantons …" articles. Aargau's entry has a myth
  entry. The 1803 decree gave the arms no meaning, and the rivers-and-fertile-soil reading is 20th
  century. 19th-century sources read the stars as Baden, the Freie Ämter and the Fricktal.
- Liechtenstein: the arms sections of the German Wikipedia municipality articles.
- Limburg: the Dutch Wikipedia flag article, and FOTW for the designer (the architect Maris) and
  the 1880s refusals of a white-and-red flag.
- Comoros: FOTW, and English Wikipedia for the national flag's stripe for each island.
- Tristan da Cunha and Ascension: the English Wikipedia flag and arms articles.
- Russia: the Russian Wikipedia flag and arms articles. Moscow's entry has a myth entry: the
  rider was read as Saint George only from the 1710s. Before that it stood for the sovereign.

**Identical flags in the Sub-national game.** Balzers and Gamprin fly the same flag (FOTW
li-ba.html). Measuring every same-country pair of division flags found four more identical pairs
already in the game: Ajman and Dubai, Ras Al Khaimah and Sharjah, Nariño and Vichada, and the two
Corsican departments. A player who named the other member of a pair was marked wrong.
- `src/data/identicalSubdivisionFlags.ts` lists the five pairs, each with a source. The game now
  accepts either answer, and the reveal names the other division.
- `scripts/check-identical-subdivision-flags.mjs` (in `flags:check` and CI) fails on any
  near-identical pair that is neither declared nor reviewed. It records five pairs checked by eye
  and found different. The closest is Ida-Viru and Lääne-Viru, whose arms differ only in the
  colour of the tower roof.

**Haute-Savoie's explainer described a different image.** It described the department's arms as a
banner. The bundled flag is the Savoy cross with "Haute-Savoie" written on it. FOTW says the
department has no flag of its own, and that this version is sometimes used to tell it from Savoie,
for instance at sports events. The explainer now says that. Which image French departments should
show is still open (see the judgement areas below).

**San Andrés.** Natural Earth's English name for CO-SAP was "Archipelago of Saint Andréws". It is
now "San Andrés and Providencia", as English Wikipedia names the department.

**Colombia's types.** Natural Earth kept statuses abolished in 1991. Five departments were typed
"Commissiary" (a misspelling) and four "Intendancy", including Caquetá, a department since 1981.
Bogotá was a "Federal District". Article 309 of the 1991 Constitution made them all departments,
and article 322 makes Bogotá a capital district. Type overrides in `build-subdivision-meta.mjs`.

**Moscow and Saint Petersburg are city-territories.** They are federal cities under article 65 of
the Russian Constitution, so they join `CITY_TERRITORY_CODES`.

## Batch 6a — wrong capitals found by the capital-flag scan (2026-09-26)

**North Sulawesi's capital was Gorontalo; it is Manado.** Wikidata's North Sulawesi item (Q5068)
lists two capitals. One is Gorontalo, the capital of the province that split off in 2000. The
generator picked it, so ID-SA carried Gorontalo's population and Gorontalo City's flag, and so did
the quiz. The Learn panel's name check hid it there, because the map already said Manado.
- The generator now pins ID-SA to Manado (Q15847) and rejects the Gorontalo flag.
- Manado's own flag, the city arms on white, is bundled from Commons ("City Flag of Manado.png",
  public domain in Indonesia). It matches FOTW's image on
  [id-sa-c](https://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/id-sa-c.html).
- Population: 462,658, BPS's mid-2025 estimate (Kota Manado Dalam Angka 2026, as cited by English
  Wikipedia). The 2020 census gave 451,916.
- The flag's explainer comes from the city government's account of its arms, as published by
  iNews Sulut (12 September 2022). The official page itself refuses automated reads.

**Schellenberg's capital was Vaduz.** Wikidata's Schellenberg item (Q49655) gives Vaduz as its
capital, although Vaduz is a different municipality (LI-11). The app showed Vaduz as
Schellenberg's capital, with Vaduz's flag and a map marker at Vaduz.
- The capital card, the flag and the map marker are gone.
- The new `scripts/data/wikidata-capital-rejected.json` records the rejection. Both capital
  generators honour it, and `check-capital-flags.mjs` fails if the capital comes back.

**Vaduz's own explainer described arms that are not on its flag.** The flag is three stripes,
red, white and red (1:1:2). The municipality's official page says the flag was granted in 1932
with the first arms and confirmed unchanged when new arms were granted in 1978. FOTW explains that
the stripes follow the first arms' red field with its white bar. The explainer now says that.

## Batch 6b — the quiz accepts identical capital flags; flags no source supports (2026-09-26 to 29)

*Shipped in #1717 (`6d8406e`); live since 29 September 2026, 7:37 PM AEST.*

**The quiz now accepts identical capital flags.** Batch 5 taught the Sub-national flags game to
accept two divisions that fly the same flag. Capital cities were still left out. In a deck of
divisions and capitals, Kyiv's flag asked as "the capital of Kyiv Oblast" marked the answer "Kyiv"
(the city's own division) wrong. The game now marks answers by key: a division's code, or
`capital:` and the code of the division it is the capital of. `identicalSubdivisionFlags.ts`
groups keys, 47 groups in all, each with its own sources:
- **One city in two roles (29 groups).** Kyiv; Minsk; Bogotá; Prague; Addis Ababa (the Oromia
  government sits there, a claim the federal constitution does not recognise); Zagreb; Budapest and
  18 other Hungarian county seats that are also cities with county rights; Bishkek; Oslo; Port
  Moresby; Honiara; Sofia (the capital of both Sofia City and Sofia Province). Each capital is
  sourced from the region's English Wikipedia infobox, or from the Counties of Hungary table.
- **One design, two or more places (13 new groups).** Each place's own flag is documented with the same
  colours in the same layout:

  | Places | Design | Sources |
  |---|---|---|
  | Bolívar department, Ibagué | yellow, green, red stripes | es.wikipedia *Bandera de Bolívar*; FOTW co-tolib |
  | Cesar department, Tunja | green, white, green stripes | es.wikipedia *Bandera de Cesar*; FOTW co-boytu |
  | Arauca, Manizales | white, green, red stripes | FOTW co-araar (Acuerdo 018 of 2001); FOTW co-cal-m (quoting the Caldas government) |
  | Prague, České Budějovice | yellow over red | cs.wikipedia *Vlajka Prahy*; cs.wikipedia *České Budějovice* |
  | Baden-Württemberg, Munich | black over gold | de.wikipedia *Flagge Baden-Württembergs*; de.wikipedia *München* ("Die Münchner Stadtflagge zeigt diese beiden Farben längsgestreift") |
  | Esmeraldas Province, Zamora canton | white over green | FOTW ec-e; zamora.gob.ec *Símbolos patrios* (FOTW's 2001 white over black for Zamora is outdated) |
  | Grenoble, Lons-le-Saunier | red and gold, divided vertically | partir-ici.fr; FOTW fr-39-ls (2021 photo) |
  | Warsaw, Łódź | gold over red | pl.wikipedia *Warszawa*; pl.wikipedia *Flaga Łodzi* |
  | Alessandria, Bologna, Genoa, Milan, Padua, Varese | red cross on white | FOTW pages for each city (CISV images) |
  | Ascoli Piceno, Bergamo, Naples, Ravenna | yellow and red, divided vertically | FOTW; it.wikipedia *Napoli* |
  | Asti, Como, Novara, Pavia | white cross on red | FOTW (Asti, Novara); it.wikipedia (Como, Pavia) |
  | Brescia, Isernia | white and blue, divided vertically | FOTW it-bs-bs; it.wikipedia *Isernia* |
  | Caserta, Catania | red and blue, divided vertically | FOTW it-csrta, it-ct-ct |

  The five groups that already existed (Ajman and Dubai, Ras Al Khaimah and Sharjah, Nariño and
  Vichada, the two Corsican departments, Balzers and Gamprin) are unchanged.
- **Checked and different.** Mantua's red cross carries Virgil in the upper hoist (FOTW it-mantu),
  so it is not grouped with Alessandria. Córdoba's top stripe is blue, not Tunja's green. Navarre,
  Tarragona and Cuenca carry different arms on red.
- The answer reveal names every twin ("…fly the same flag — any of these answers counts").
- `check-identical-subdivision-flags.mjs` now compares capital flags with the divisions and the
  other capitals of the same country. It checks a group's consistency with a shade-tolerant step
  (96, failing at 10%), requires a note and a source for every group, and gains two report modes,
  `--scan` and `--same-city`.

**Capital flags no source supports: 11 removed.** Each is recorded, with its evidence, in
`scripts/data/capital-flag-rejected.json`, so a regeneration cannot restore it. The explainers
that described these images are removed.

| Code | Capital | What it showed | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| IT-RN | Rimini | Plain white and red bicolour, drawn on Commons with no source | FOTW it-rn-rn: the flag is white with the city arms (flagsonline.it); the comune's gonfalone carries the arms |
| IT-TE | Teramo | Plain white and red bicolour, no source | The gonfalone granted by DPR 11 September 2001 is white with a red border and the arms (it.wikipedia); FOTW it-te-te gives the older town flag as red and white with red at the hoist |
| IT-OR | Oristano | Plain white and red bicolour, drawn from Cagliari's file | No flag documented: no FOTW page, and it.wikipedia describes none |
| SY-DI, SY-RD | Damascus | Commons "Flag of Damascus (until 2024).svg", the governorate's logo flag | Commons records it as used until 2024. No later flag is documented (Commons category, FOTW sy-di) |
| MA-01 | Tangier | The Wilaya of Tangier's flag | FOTW ma-: the wilaya flags of 1976 are listed apart from city flags |
| MA-02, MA-03, MA-05, MA-09 | Oujda, Taza, Beni Mellal, Settat | Kénitra, Fès (twice) and Settat *province* flags | Commons "Flags of provinces of Morocco" |
| MA-10 | Guelmim | Sidi Bennour's flag | A different place |

**Italian province flags that were not the province's flag: 3 suppressed.** The documented flags
exist, but no free image of them does.
- **IT-TR Terni** showed a plain yellow and blue field. it.wikipedia describes the province's flag
  as *"partito di giallo e di azzurro con lo stemma della provincia al centro"*, with the arms at the
  centre. Commons' own-work file renders with its arms layer hidden. The only depiction (Araldica
  Civica, via it.wikipedia) is licensed to Wikipedia alone.
- **IT-UD Udine** showed the same kind of plain blue and yellow field, the Commons own-work file of
  2012. FOTW/CISV and bandieredalvivo.com, which photographed the flag at the provincial seat in
  2018, both show the provincial arms (a golden eagle) at the centre.
- **IT-TA Taranto** showed a plain red and blue field, the city's colours. The province has arms and
  a blue-and-red gonfalone (it.wikipedia; FOTW it-ta shows the arms only). Commons' "Flag of the
  Province of Taranto.svg" is a 2022 own-work drawing with no source.
- **IT-FE Ferrara was checked and is right.** Its plain white-over-light-blue flag is the CISV
  description, and bandieredalvivo.com photographed it at the provincial offices in 2010.

**Belarus.** Natural Earth swapped the two Minsk units' types and gave both the name "Minsk". BY-MI
is now **Minsk Region** (Region) and BY-HM is **Minsk** (City), per ISO 3166-2:BY. The
city-territory entry moves from the region to the city, so Minsk Region's capital card now shows
Minsk and its flag.

**Names.** BG-23 is now "Sofia Province" (en.wikipedia), so it no longer shares the name of Sofia
City. IT-GE is now "Genoa": Natural Earth had given the region's name, "Liguria", to the
metropolitan city.

**Grenoble's explainer** is rewritten from partir-ici.fr (Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes Tourisme) and
fr.wikipedia's *Armoiries de Grenoble*. The flag is red at the hoist and gold at the fly. The text
gives both readings of the three roses, Bouchayer's and Ménestrier's, the 1575 engraving, and the
registration in the Armorial général on 13 June 1698. FOTW's 2001 description of the flag as red and
white is the outlier.

**Found in passing, and queued in the handbook.** Iran's capital data uses the 2018 ISO codes while
its map uses the old ones, so Hormozgan shows Tehran (SF-03). The quiz does not apply the panel's
capital-name check (SF-02). Taranto's city flag and about 80 other Italian capital flags are not
yet checked against FOTW (SF-04).

## Batch 7a — Iran: every province carried another province's data (2026-09-29)

*Shipped in #1720 (`141cf7f`); live since 29 September 2026, 8:21 PM AEST.*

**What was wrong.** The Iran map (`public/subdivisions/IR.json`) carried the ISO 3166-2:IR codes in
force before the 2018 update. Every Wikidata-keyed dataset uses the current codes, and the two
schemes reuse the same numbers for different provinces, so all 31 provinces showed another
province's data:
- Hormozgan (map code IR-23) showed Tehran Province's 13,267,637 people (2016 census) and Tehran as
  its capital; the capital quiz used Tehran's flag for it. Hormozgan has 1,776,415 people.
- Fars (IR-14) showed Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari's 947,763; Bushehr (IR-06) showed Khuzestan's
  4,710,509; Qazvin (IR-28) showed North Khorasan's name in Persian. The same applied everywhere.
- Tehran and Alborz had no code, so the app keyed them by name. Markazi, Fars and Razavi Khorasan
  had no capital card, because their current codes (IR-00, IR-07, IR-09) did not exist on the
  map. North Khorasan was patched through a one-off alias (IR-28 → IR-31).
- The quiz asked Tabriz, Urmia, Tehran and Qom as the capitals of Ardabil, Isfahan, Hormozgan and
  Yazd.

**Fix.**
- The 31 map features now carry the current codes. Each comes from Wikidata's P300 on the province
  item, and all 31 match the ISO table in English Wikipedia's "ISO 3166-2:IR" (IR-00 Markazi …
  IR-30 Alborz). The geometry is byte-for-byte unchanged, and the alias is removed.
- Regenerated from their sources: the division list, the map's capital points (`cities.ts`, where
  only Iran's lines changed) and the national-capital host (Tehran → IR-23).
- Populations were already keyed by the current codes; the stray IR-31 duplicate is removed.
- From a fresh Wikidata run, only Iran's lines were taken: capital details for Markazi (Arak,
  520,944, 2016 census), Fars (Shiraz, 1,565,572, 2016 census), Razavi Khorasan (Mashhad,
  3,208,000, 2020 estimate) and North Khorasan (Bojnord, 228,931, 2016 census), and the native
  names of those provinces and capitals. The same run drifted 27 unrelated entries elsewhere;
  those were left as they are.
- Alborz had no capital on the map: Natural Earth predates the province (2010) and tags no capital
  for it. Its capital, Karaj (Wikidata Q36529, the province's P36), now comes from the Wikidata
  fallback layer (`subdivisionCapitals.ts`). Only that one line was taken from a fresh run of its
  generator; the same run drifted 33 unrelated lines, which were left alone.
- Three capitals showed no population, because Natural Earth spells them differently from the
  Wikidata item the population comes from, and the panel only shows a figure when the names agree.
  A new, cited table in `build-cities.mjs` (`SUBNATIONAL_NAME_ALIAS`) now gives each the Wikidata
  English name: Bandar-e Bushehr → Bushehr (Q158928), Bandar-e-Abbas → Bandar Abbas (Q154814) and
  Bojnurd → Bojnord (Q317946). Same city, same coordinates. Batch 7b uses the same table for the
  other spelling mismatches.

**Result.** All 31 provinces were checked in the running build. Each shows its own population,
capital, capital population and native names, and there were no page errors. The quiz asks
Tabriz, Urmia, Tehran and Qom as the capitals of East Azerbaijan, West Azerbaijan, Tehran and
Qom.

## Batch 7b — six more maps where polygons carried another region's code (2026-09-29)

*Shipped in #1727 (`8311a07`); live since 30 September 2026, 1:31 AM AEST.*

**How they were found.** After Iran, a scan tested every map polygon in the app against Wikidata.
For each ISO 3166-2 code, it checked whether the region's own coordinates (P625) and its capital's
coordinates (P36 → P625) fall inside the polygon carrying that code. When both points land in the
same other polygon, and that polygon's points land back in the first, the map has the codes on the
wrong outlines. English Wikipedia's ISO tables, Natural Earth's own towns and Flags of the World
confirmed each case. The scan is now `scripts/flag-audit/geo-code-scan.mjs`.

**What was wrong.** A polygon that carries another region's code shows that region's flag,
population, capital and native name.
- **Ecuador:** the Napo and Tungurahua outlines were swapped. The polygon around Ambato was
  labelled Napo, so it showed Napo's flag, and Napo's capital was given as Ambato. That capital is
  also in the quiz.
- **Eritrea:** four of the six regions were rotated. Asmara sat in "Anseba", Keren in "Northern Red
  Sea", Massawa in "Debub" and Mendefera in "Maekel".
- **Guyana:** eight of the ten regions carried another region's name and code. For example,
  Georgetown sat in "East Berbice-Corentyne". Essequibo Islands-West Demerara also carried the
  English name "Mahaica-Berbice", so two regions had the same name.
- **Afghanistan:** Paktia and Paktika had each other's codes.
- **Latvia:** Sala and Salacgrīva had each other's codes.
- **Uganda:** the map used the district numbering from before ISO's 2010 renumbering, so 33
  districts had another district's code. Mityana showed Lyantonde's data, and so on. One polygon
  labelled a second "Mbarara" is Kiruhura District: Wikidata's centre for Kiruhura (Q1318865)
  lies inside it. In addition, 23 districts were typed "County", and Kampala "District". ISO lists
  every one as a district, and Kampala as a city. Ugandan counties are units below the district.

**Fix.**
- In `public/subdivisions/{EC,ER,GY,AF,LV,UG}.json`, each region's properties now sit on its own
  polygon. This was done with a string-level edit of the properties, and the geometry was checked
  to be byte-for-byte unchanged.
- The Ugandan codes follow the current ISO table matched by district name. Luwero, Kibaale and
  Bukomansimbi keep their codes, because only their spelling differs from ISO's. Bukwa is Bukwo
  (UG-220). Omoro (UG-331), created in 2016, has no polygon of its own.
- Regenerated from these files:
  - the division list and the map capitals, where only these six countries changed;
  - the national-capital hosts: Asmara is now in Maekel, Georgetown in Demerara-Mahaica;
  - the Wikidata fallback capitals, taking only these countries' lines. This adds New Amsterdam,
    Lyantonde, Isingiro, Kibingo (Sheema), Nwoya and Buhweju.
- Capital details for the two districts new to the map come from a fresh Wikidata run: Isingiro
  (UG-418) and Sheema (UG-426, capital Kibingo). The same run drifted many unrelated entries,
  which were left alone.
- Paktia's capital is spelled Gardez (Wikidata Q467632; Natural Earth has "Gardiz"), using the
  alias table from 7a.
- The flags were already filed under the right ISO codes, so they now appear on the right
  outlines. `EC-T.svg` is the Commons file "Bandera Provincia Tungurahua". `EC-N.svg` matches
  the Napo image on FOTW (ec-n.html, reached from ec-.html): yellow over white, blue and red.

**Checks.**
- Capital agreement for the six countries: 251 before, 259 after. None of the codes that still
  disagree shows a different capital than before on the same outline.
- The scan now reports none of these countries. Its remaining swaps are Morocco (SF-03) and
  Antigua. The Antigua pair are border villages on coarse outlines; the polygons' extents match
  the parishes.
- Quiz capitals that disagree with the panel: 77 → 76 (Napo's capital is Tena again).

**Left for later, recorded in the handbook.**
- Wrong Natural Earth capitals, the batch 7c class. Paktika shows "Zareh Sharan", 50 km from
  its capital Sharana. Napak shows Moroto and Kiryandongo shows Masindi-Port, because the coarse
  outlines put those towns on the wrong side of the line.
- Sources disagree on Demerara-Mahaica's capital. English Wikipedia says Georgetown, and Wikidata
  says Paradise. The map shows Georgetown.
- Maps older than the current structure (SF-14): Uganda's 23 districts created in 2010–2020, and
  Kazakhstan's 2022 regions.

## Batch 7c — 64 quiz capitals now agree with the map (2026-09-29)

*Shipped in #1728 (`67773b5`); live since 30 September 2026, 1:59 AM AEST.*

**What was wrong.** A capital-flag question uses the capital that Wikidata records (P36), while
the Learn panel shows the capital from Natural Earth. The panel shows the capital's population and
flag only when the two names agree (`sameCity()` in `src/lib/capitalInfo.ts`). After 7a and 7b,
76 of the 1,255 quiz capitals still disagreed. Blindly dropping them would have removed correct
questions. Instead, each was traced to whichever source was wrong.

**Fix: map side, in `scripts/build-cities.mjs`.** Each row cites the capital's Wikidata item.
- **Spelling and renamed cities, 43 rows in `SUBNATIONAL_NAME_ALIAS`.** Each is the same city at
  the same coordinates, now carrying Wikidata's English name.
  - Spellings: Gent → Ghent, Homyel → Gomel, Odessa → Odesa, St.  Paul → Saint Paul.
  - Natural Earth typos: Pizen, Alba Lulia, Oostanay.
  - Renamings: Kirovohrad → Kropyvnytskyi (2016); Nueva San Salvador → Santa Tecla (2003);
    Qapshaghay → Qonayev (2022); Jalal-Abad → Manas (September 2025, per English Wikipedia's
    "Jalal-Abad").
  - Official names: Heroica Puebla de Zaragoza, Santiago de Querétaro, San Fernando del Valle
    de Catamarca.
  - Abkhazia's capital follows Wikidata's English label, Sokhumi.
- **A different city that Natural Earth has, 13 rows in `SUBNATIONAL_OVERRIDE`:**
  - Granma → Bayamo (not Manzanillo);
  - Badajoz province → Badajoz (not Mérida);
  - Oromia → Addis Ababa;
  - Qaasuitsup → Ilulissat;
  - Almaty Region → Qonayev (not Taldykorgan, since 2022);
  - Turkistan Region → Turkistan (not Shymkent, since 2018);
  - Akershus → Oslo;
  - Hawke's Bay → Napier;
  - Manawatū-Whanganui → Palmerston North;
  - Lima Region → Huacho (not Huaura);
  - Central Equatoria → Juba (not Yei);
  - Maldonado → Maldonado (not Punta del Este);
  - Capital District → Caracas (not Los Teques).
- **A wrong capital where Natural Earth lacks the right city, 10 rows in a new
  `NE_CAPITAL_BLOCK`.** The Natural Earth capital is dropped, so the Wikidata fallback layer
  supplies the right city with its own coordinates:
  - Pohnpei → Kolonia (not Palikir);
  - Shida Kartli → Gori (not Tskhinvali);
  - South Kalimantan → Banjarbaru (not Banjarmasin, since 2022);
  - Northern District → Nof HaGalil (not Nazareth; English Wikipedia's infobox agrees);
  - Østfold → Sarpsborg (not Moss);
  - Benguet → La Trinidad (not Baguio);
  - Central Department → Areguá (not Ypacaraí);
  - Ingushetia → Magas (not Nazran);
  - Harghita → Miercurea Ciuc (Natural Earth's point is 21 km off);
  - Paktika → Sharana (Natural Earth's "Zareh Sharan" is 50 km away).

**Fix: Wikidata side.** Laguna's item lists three capitals: Bay (until 1688), Pagsanjan (until
1858) and Santa Cruz. The fallback kept Bay. `GAP_CAPITAL_CITY_QIDS` in
`build-subdivision-capitals.mjs` now pins Santa Cruz (Q75938), as English Wikipedia's "Laguna
(province)" gives it. Only the eleven affected rows were taken from a fresh run of that
generator.

**Map labels.** A capital marker can now belong to several territories (`ownerCodes` in
`src/lib/cityRoles.ts`). Oslo is both Oslo's capital and Akershus's seat, and Addis Ababa both its
own city-state's and Oromia's capital. Hovering either one reveals the name. Before, only the
first claimant did. This was already a problem for Kyiv, Sofia and Minsk. The overlay stays
`pointer-events: none`.

**Result.** 76 → 12 quiz capitals disagree with the panel. In the other 64, the panel now shows
the population and flag of the capital the quiz asks about.

**The 12 left, for batch 7d.** Each needs a Wikidata-side decision, a new capital flag and an
explainer:
- Wikidata's pick is wrong or out of date: Bali (Singaraja → Denpasar), Southeast Sulawesi
  (Bau-Bau → Kendari), Central Kalimantan (Pahandut, a district → Palangka Raya).
- The region has two seats: Appenzell Ausserrhoden (Trogen/Herisau), the Azores
  (Angra/Ponta Delgada), Tipperary (Nenagh/Clonmel), Forlì-Cesena, Pesaro and Urbino, and
  Olbia-Tempio.
- Tokyo: Shinjuku is the seat district, as with Seoul.
- Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts: the quiz uses the seats Ukraine relocated in 2014
  (Siverskodonetsk, Kramatorsk), while the map shows Luhansk and Donetsk.

## Batch 7d — the last 12 quiz capitals, eight wrong-entity capital flags, and a gate (2026-09-30)

*Shipped in #1730 (`28316d5`); live since 30 September 2026, 9:25 AM AEST.*

**The 12 from 7c, each fixed on the Wikidata side.** `CAPITAL_CITY_QIDS` in
`scripts/build-capital-details.mjs` pins the capital where Wikidata's P36 is out of date or lists
several seats. Each row names the city's own item and why:
- **Out of date or not a city.** Bali → Denpasar (Singaraja was the colonial capital, 1849–1960).
  Southeast Sulawesi → Kendari (Wikidata also lists Bau-Bau). Central Kalimantan → Palangka Raya
  (Pahandut is a district of the city).
- **Two or three seats; the one that houses the government.** Appenzell Ausserrhoden → Herisau
  (government and parliament; Trogen keeps the courts). Azores → Ponta Delgada (the Regional
  Government; Angra has the judiciary, Horta the assembly). Pesaro and Urbino → Pesaro (the
  provincial offices). Forlì-Cesena → Cesena (both are capitals under decree-law 7/2024).
  Olbia-Tempio → Olbia (both it and Tempio were capitals; abolished 2016). Medio Campidano →
  Sanluri (Sanluri and Villacidro were both capitals). Tipperary → Nenagh (county towns Nenagh and Clonmel; the council meets in
  both).
- **Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts** keep their de jure centres, Luhansk and Donetsk, not the seats
  relocated in 2014.
- **Tokyo.** Shinjuku is the ward where the Metropolitan Government stands, not a capital; it joins
  Seoul in `SEAT_DISTRICT_NOT_A_CAPITAL`, and its ward flag leaves the capital card.

The map side needed three fallback pins (`GAP_CAPITAL_CITY_QIDS`: Cesena, Nenagh, Sanluri) and
one population (Nenagh, 9,895, CSO Census 2022, in `CAPITAL_POPULATION_OVERRIDES`). The
capital-endonym generator now takes a native name only when Wikidata's capital is the capital the
app shows. Before, Central Kalimantan and Forlì-Cesena showed a native name for a different city.

**Capital flags.** Four slots now hold the right city's flag. Two were the old seat's flag:
Trogen's in Herisau's slot and Sievierodonetsk's in Luhansk's. Angra do Heroísmo's flag gives way
to Ponta Delgada's. The Donetsk slot already held Commons' "Flag of Donetsk.svg" (same sha1),
though the manifest named "Flag of Kramatorsk.svg", so the quiz had asked "Kramatorsk" beside
Donetsk's flag. Herisau's and Luhansk's are PNG renders from Commons' own thumbnailer. The
media server (upload.wikimedia.org) returned 429 to this environment for hours; the downloader
uses the same route for oversized files.

**Wrong-entity capital flags removed**, each with its evidence in
`scripts/data/capital-flag-rejected.json`:
- Bistrița, Baia Mare, Zalău, Satu Mare and Sombor showed their **1941** flags. Commons files
  them as "Flag of Beszterce (1941)" and so on, from the Hungarian book of that year, during the
  wartime annexation. FOTW keeps each in its history section. None is the city's flag today.
- Malabo showed the "Former flag of Santa Isabel", the colonial name.
- Central Kalimantan showed the flag of **Banjarmasin**, a city in another province.
- Tipperary showed a blue-and-gold bicolour: the county's GAA colours, not Nenagh's flag.

**Explainers.** New, from the sources named in each entry: Denpasar (the city's own emblem
explanation, in its 2024 statistical profile), Herisau (the municipality's "Das Herisauer Wappen"
and FOTW), Ponta Delgada (FOTW), Luhansk (uk.wikipedia; the 1992 decision recreating the imperial
arms) and Donetsk (uk.wikipedia). Pesaro's was rewritten for Pesaro's own flag. Kendari, Olbia and
Sanluri stay omitted: their sources give the blazon but no meaning (reasons logged with the FOTW
pages checked).

**The gate.** `scripts/check-capital-name-agreement.mjs` (in `flags:check` and the
`flag-integrity` workflow) fails when a quiz capital is not the capital the Learn panel shows. It
mirrors `sameCity()` and the quiz rule, and fails if either changes without it. 81 → 0.

**Found while doing this, for later batches:**
- 57 capital flags that the 7c and 7d name fixes made visible were still logged as "hidden by the
  name guard", so they show with no explainer (batch 7e). Arkhangelsk is both explained in
  `cityFlagMeanings.ts` and logged as omitted.
- A wider class of wrong-entity capital flags (batch 7f): governorate flags in four Egyptian
  capital slots, Guatemalan department flags in four, Irish county GAA colours in four, Pasco
  Province's flag for Cerro de Pasco, and Savoy's flag for Timișoara.

## Batch 7f — 20 capital flags that belong to someone else, or to no one (2026-09-30)

*Shipped in #1732 (`1a7c5fe`); live since 30 September 2026, 7:49 PM AEST.*

**How they were found.** A scan of every capital flag's Commons filename for the word for a
province, department, governorate, county, region or district, in a dozen languages. A scan of
the 57 capital flags the 7c/7d name fixes made visible. And the flags deferred from earlier
batches. Each candidate was then checked against FOTW and, where FOTW was silent, the
local-language Wikipedia and the Commons file page. Evidence for each is in
`scripts/data/capital-flag-rejected.json`.

**Removed:**
- **A governorate's flag in the city's slot (Egypt).** Mansoura, Marsa Matruh and Arish showed the
  2006 flags of Dakahlia, Matrouh and North Sinai governorates; Minya showed the Minya
  governorate's Nefertiti flag (FOTW eg-g-daq, eg-g-mat, eg-g-nsi, eg-g-mny).
- **A department's flag, or a variant of it, that is not the city's (Guatemala).** Jalapa's city
  flag is a plain red, yellow and green tricolour; Jutiapa's is green-white-green with the arms
  (FOTW gt-ja-ja, gt-ju-ju). The slots held a department variant and the bare department arms in
  a wreath.
- **A province's flag (Peru).** Cerro de Pasco showed Pasco Province's flag. The city spans
  three districts of that province; es.wikipedia only reuses the province flag in its infobox.
- **County GAA colours (Ireland).** Cork, Limerick, Longford and Waterford showed their county's
  sporting colours. FOTW ie-col: county colours come from the county teams and stand for the
  county. Tullamore's blue and white bicolour is an unsourced 2011 upload, not Offaly's colours
  (green, white and gold), and FOTW lists no Tullamore flag.
- **Logos, a photograph, and unsourced drawings.** Abuja showed its logo on white (FOTW: the flag
  is green). San Carlos showed its town hall's logo (FOTW: blue over green with the arms).
  Luxembourg City showed a photograph of flags on a building. Sokhumi showed a 2025 own-work
  drawing that Commons tags `{{factual accuracy}}`. Gori showed a 2016 own-work key flag, while
  FOTW gives the flag the Municipal Council decreed in 2010: quartered red and blue by a red cross.
- **A proposal.** Querétaro's file is "Propuesta de Bandera del Municipio de Querétaro", a 2022
  proposal that Commons tags `{{fictitious flag}}`.
- **A plain field missing its arms.** Jinotepe's flag carries the municipal arms on its
  purple-yellow-blue stripes (FOTW ni-cr-ji, with photos); the file had none.
- **Timișoara.** The file is the flag of Savoy. Its design is also the 1941 Hungarian-era flag of
  Temesvár (FOTW ro-timis#hist) and the banner on the tower in the city's arms, but no source
  documents it as the city's flag today. This is the same case as the five 1941 flags in 7d.

**Kept, after checking.** Three filenames looked wrong, but the design is the city's documented flag:
- Gap: the file is Beaugency's, but FOTW fr-05-ga documents Gap's flag as the same blue and yellow
  vertical bicolour.
- Escuintla: FOTW gt-es-es says the city flag is the same as the department's.
- Antigua Guatemala: FOTW gt-sa-an shows the city flag as green-white-green with its arms, the
  design the "Sacatepéquez Department" file shows.

Also checked and kept:
- Addis Ababa: the city emblem on white, FOTW et-aa.
- Juba: orange, with the "Juba City Council" scroll, FOTW ss-juba.
- Palmerston North: white, with the arms and names, FOTW nz-mwt.
- Ocotal: the seal on white, FOTW ni-ns-oc.
- Somoto: blue-white-red, FOTW ni-md-so.
- Toulouse: the Cross of Toulouse, FOTW fr-31-tl.
- Nice: the greater arms on white, FOTW fr-06-ni.
- Palma: Mallorca's flag, by the 2006 capital law, FOTW es-pm-pm.
- Port Moresby: the NCDC flag, FOTW pg-nc.
- Cagayan de Oro: the seal on red, FOTW ph-x.
- Foix: the county's banner of arms, FOTW fr-09-fx.
- Krasnogorsk: the urban okrug's flag, per ru.wikipedia.
- Oslo: FOTW no-03-01 says the St Hallvard flag on blue has been the city's flag in use since 2002,
  though never approved by royal resolution. The Commons note that it "is not approved by the
  Norwegian government" is true, and not a reason to drop it.
- Bruges: Commons calls the file "an unofficial version", meaning an unofficial drawing; it matches
  FOTW's official flag.
- Juba: the Commons drawing was traced from an alternate-history wiki, but it matches FOTW's
  independent 2019 drawing. Its orange is paler, so swap it when a better drawing can be fetched.
- Dubrovnik: the St Blaise flag. The bundled drawing adds a gold border that the statute flag
  lacks, so swap it for a borderless drawing when one can be fetched.

**For later:**
- These are the departments' and governorates' own flags, which the division cards do not show.
  They belong with SF-06: Guatemala's department flags, with Mundo Chapín's explainers for Jalapa
  and Jutiapa, and the Minya governorate's Nefertiti flag.
- Real city flags to bundle when Commons downloads work again:
  - Cork and Limerick city councils (FOTW ie-cork, ie-lim);
  - Abuja's green flag;
  - San Carlos's blue and green flag;
  - Gori's 2010 flag;
  - Jalapa's and Jutiapa's city flags.
- Governorate and province flags still sit in capital slots that `SHARED_CAPITAL_FLAGS` hides.
  They are Aswan, Damietta, Giza, Qalyubia, Kafr El-Sheikh and Sohag (Egypt); Alajuela and
  Puntarenas; Esmeraldas and Tungurahua; Mandalay and Yangon; Colón; Salto and Rivera; the El
  Salvador departments; and Madre de Dios. They show nowhere today, but would reappear if the
  division flag changes, as Minya's did.

## Batch 7e — the capital flags the name fixes made visible (2026-09-30)

*Shipped in #1733 (`342a5e0`); live since 30 September 2026, 8:48 PM AEST.*

**What was wrong.** Batches 7c and 7d made every quiz capital the capital the Learn panel shows.
That made 46 more capital flags render. Their omission lines still said "structurally unreachable,
name-guard mismatch", so they showed with no explainer, and the stale reasons kept them out of the
sweep. Arkhangelsk was both explained and logged as omitted. Each flag was researched from scratch,
starting with FOTW and then the local-language Wikipedia, official pages and heraldic sources.

**Explainers added (32), each read from its cited source:**
- Belgium, Switzerland, Czechia: Ghent, Bruges, St. Gallen, Plzeň.
- Norway and Sweden: Sarpsborg, Oslo (St Hallvard's seal; en.wikipedia "Coat of arms of Oslo"),
  Gothenburg (sv.wikipedia "Göteborgs stadsvapen").
- Nicaragua: Boaco, Juigalpa, Matagalpa.
- Ukraine: Vinnytsia, Uzhhorod, Zaporizhzhia, Kropyvnytskyi, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Khmelnytskyi.
  Sources: uk.wikipedia and the city councils' own symbols pages (Mykolaiv, Khmelnytskyi).
- Romania: Alba Iulia, Sfântu Gheorghe, Târgu Mureș (HG 486/2000, via Lege5).
- Russia: Krasnogorsk (the urban okrug's own symbolism page), Veliky Novgorod, Oryol.
- Americas: Saint Paul, San Ignacio, Puebla (El Universal Puebla, citing INAH), Caracas,
  Maldonado (FOTW uy-ma-).
- Asia-Pacific: Palmerston North (council heritage archive), La Trinidad and Santa Cruz (NHCP
  heraldry pages for the seals), Banjarbaru.

**Judgement calls, stated in the explainers rather than hidden:**
- Kropyvnytskyi's 1996 flag carries the monogram of Empress Elizabeth. In February 2025 the
  Ukrainian Institute of National Memory recommended removing it. The council's toponymic
  commission is designing new symbols; no new flag had been adopted when this was checked
  (September 2026).
- Sfântu Gheorghe's flag was adopted by the city council in 2010. The government approved it in
  2021, but on 22 February 2023 the High Court annulled that approval, after a challenge by the
  Civic Forum of Romanians of Covasna, Harghita and Mureș. The flag and its status are stated
  neutrally.
- Caracas's 2022 flag: El Diario reports that no official explanation of its elements was given,
  and the explainer says so instead of supplying one.
- Veliky Novgorod: ru.wikipedia notes that historians dispute what the arms' figures stood for.
- Oryol's 1998 flag has a hammer and sickle. The Heraldic Council under the President found it
  non-conforming, but the replacement designs of 2010 and 2014 were never adopted.

**Replaced (1).** Khmelnytskyi's capital flag was the square blue flag with a gold border. Council
decision No. 13 of 22 March 2017 made that the mayor's standard, and set a 2:3 city flag without
the border (khm.gov.ua, "Символи міста"). The current flag is now bundled as a Commons render,
pinned in `CAPITAL_FLAG_SOURCE_OVERRIDES`, and the old file is rejected with the decision as
evidence.

**Removed (3)**, with evidence in `capital-flag-rejected.json`:
- **Granada (Nicaragua)** showed Granada **department's previous flag**, the one replaced in 2019
  (FOTW ni-gr). The city's own flag is white with the arms (FOTW ni-gr-gr); no free file of it yet.
- **Huacho** and **Areguá**: own-work Commons uploads with no source. No other source documents a
  flag. Huacho has only its 1964 arms (es.wikipedia "Símbolos de Huacho"). FOTW lists Areguá
  District with no flag (py-11-).

**Rejected, then kept (2).** The first pass rejected Banjarbaru and Juba. That rested on a miss in
FOTW's keyword index, a stale id.wikipedia note and Juba's fan-wiki source. The regional pages
document both flags from photographs: FOTW id-ks-c#bjb (2023) and ss-juba (2019); batch 7f had
already recorded the second. **FOTW's keyword index is incomplete. Before concluding FOTW has no
page, follow the country's own index pages.** This is the "a guessed 404 is never proof of
absence" rule in another form.

**Omission lines rewritten with the real reason (11).** Chinandega, León, Somoto, Masaya, Ocotal,
Kolonia, Coxen Hole (Roatán), Santa Tecla, Addis Ababa and Juba name the FOTW page checked.
Estelí is logged as an evidence conflict. FOTW shows the plain red-white-green tricolour of 2004
from personal observation. La Prensa's report of the adoption says the town emblem, El Brujito,
would be placed on the white stripe; its page sits behind a JavaScript challenge and was read only
through search extracts. It needs a photo or the ordinance.

**New gate.** `scripts/check-city-flag-meanings.mjs` (already in `flags:check` and CI) now also
fails on:
- a code that is both explained and omitted;
- an explainer or omission line with no bundled capital flag;
- an omission line that says the flag cannot be shown while it is bundled and not suppressed.

Before the fix it reported exactly the 46 stale lines and Arkhangelsk. A first version matched a
bare "unreachable", which also caught reasons about council websites being unreachable. It now
matches only claims about display.

**Also.** `build-cities.mjs` strips invisible bidi marks ("Granada\u200e") and collapses doubled
spaces ("Washington,  D.C.", "St.  Petersburg") in Natural Earth names before they reach the
capital panel. One alias was keyed on the double-spaced form ("US-MN|St.  Paul" → Saint Paul) and is re-keyed, so Saint Paul keeps its name. The misplaced "Lisbon" comment above the 7d entries in `cityFlagMeanings.ts` is
back above Lisbon.

**For later:**
- ~~RU-MO (Saransk): the capital flag is a UTF-16 SVG that the rasteriser cannot read, so
  `check-capital-flags.mjs` skips it and the national-flag guard is blind to it.~~ Re-encoded as
  UTF-8 in batch 8d.
- Granada city's white flag with the arms, when a free file exists.
- Settle Estelí's flag from a photo or the ordinance.
- Venezuela's VE-A is named "Capital" in `SUBDIVISION_META` (the map calls it "Distrito Capital"), so
  its capital card reads "Capital of Capital". Rename it Capital District in the meta generator.
- The NHCP heraldry pages give official meanings for Philippine municipal seals. Use them for the
  remaining Philippine capital seals.

## Batch 8a — Guatemala's 22 department flags, Mexico City, and an explainer-key gate (2026-09-30)

*Shipped in #1734 (`bdf5026`); live since 1 October 2026, 3:35 AM AEST.*

**What was wrong.** The app showed no flag for any of Guatemala's 22 departments. Nine flag files
were bundled, but under the numeric codes of ISO's November 2021 change (GT-01 … GT-22), while the
map and every other dataset use the alpha codes (GT-AV … GT-ZA). Nothing looked those files up.
Checked against FOTW, four of the nine were not the department's flag anyway:
- GT-01: an undocumented striped design, not Guatemala Department's.
- GT-03: Antigua's city flag, not Sacatepéquez's.
- GT-14: Santa Cruz del Quiché's city flag, not Quiché's.
- GT-19: an undocumented Zacapa design.

**Department flags now shown (17).** Each was compared with the department's FOTW page
(https://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/gt-.html, then gt-av.html … gt-za.html). Where FOTW was unsure
or wrong, the decision rests on a stronger source:
- Alta Verapaz, Chimaltenango, Chiquimula, El Progreso, Escuintla, Izabal, Jalapa, Jutiapa,
  Retalhuleu, Santa Rosa, Suchitepéquez, Totonicapán, Quetzaltenango, San Marcos and Sacatepéquez
  match FOTW's image. San Marcos's emblem is drawn differently from FOTW's but has the same volcano,
  lion and book.
- **Petén.** FOTW's image (blue-white-green, with Flores's arms) is wrong. Agreement No. 3-98 of the
  Departmental Government, 14 September 1998, created the flag: green, white and sky blue, with a
  map of the department holding the Tikal temple, a tree, xate, an oil derrick and two hands. The
  only online copy of the agreement is a transcription by the Flores historian Luis José Hernández
  González (elchilamitza.blogspot.com). It is cited as the act, not as a blog opinion. es.wikipedia
  and the Commons file show the same design.
- **Huehuetenango.** FOTW's department page shows a white flag with red and yellow rectangles, from
  Flagmaster 45 (1984). FOTW's city page (gt-hu-hu.html, from Prensa Libre, 31 December 2006) and
  mihuehue.com say the 1955 Mackepeace flag, green and yellow with a hoist triangle and the Zaculeu
  ruins, has been official for both the municipality and the department since 1987. That flag is
  shown.

Files come from Commons: Commons PNG renders of the SVGs (upload.wikimedia.org answered 429 with a
10-minute retry-after), Alta Verapaz's and Jalapa's already-bundled SVGs (identical artwork),
Escuintla's original SVG (already bundled as its capital flag), and Sacatepéquez's 360×216 FOTW GIF,
converted pixel-for-pixel to PNG so the collision and ratio tools read it.

**Not shown (5), with the reason:**
- Baja Verapaz: the current flag is white with a brown two-headed eagle (FOTW gt-bv, 2014). The
  only free file is FOTW's "previously reported" bird design.
- Guatemala: FOTW's department image is the city's flag, and FOTW notes its source does not say the
  department uses it (gt-gu-gu). The striped Commons design is undocumented.
- Quiché: the department's flag is white with the 1972 "Q" badge (FOTW gt-qc, with a 2009 photo).
  The only free file is Santa Cruz del Quiché's yellow-white-yellow city flag (gt-qc-qc).
- Sololá: FOTW documents a green-yellow-green flag with the capital's seal, but the only depicted
  version is the municipality's own flag (gt-so, 2014 note). The Commons file with a departmental
  seal has no source.
- Zacapa: FOTW records designs changing with governors; the Commons red-disc design is undocumented.

**Explainers.** Seven were written, all read from their sources: Alta Verapaz, Chimaltenango,
Jutiapa and Retalhuleu from FOTW (the last three quote governors' 1997–98 communications),
Chiquimula (FOTW, citing Mi Chiquimula, 11 September 2012), Huehuetenango (FOTW gt-hu-hu and
mihuehue.com; only the colour meanings both sources agree on) and Petén (Agreement 3-98). The other
ten are logged in `subdiv-meaning-omitted.txt`. FOTW gives no symbolism for them, and guatemala.com's
"Aprende" page is not used: it describes Chiquimula's and Izabal's city flags as the departments'.

**Capital flags.**
- Removed with evidence in `capital-flag-rejected.json`:
  - Flores: own work, no source; FOTW gt-pe-fl shows only arms. The file is Petén's tricolour with
    the old arms.
  - San Marcos: a plain triband with the colours reversed; FOTW gt-sm-sm gives red-yellow-green
    with the lion's head.
- Replaced by the department's flag, which the city shares, and so suppressed as shared:
  - Huehuetenango: the 1984 design was superseded in 1987.
  - Quetzaltenango: a plain tricolour; FOTW gt-qz-qz says the city uses the department's symbols.
- Escuintla's capital flag, the department's own, is now shared too.
- Capital explainers:
  - Removed for Petén, San Marcos, Huehuetenango, Quetzaltenango and Escuintla. Some described
    the replaced flags. Some cited Mundo Chapín, which is now offline; its Quetzaltenango and San
    Marcos pages were never archived.
  - Rewritten to match the flag shown and live sources:
    - Chiquimula: the unsupported colour meanings were removed.
    - Puerto Barrios: it had called the city flag "Izabal's flag".
    - Sololá: it quoted a ring text from a different emblem; its cited site no longer resolves.

**Mexico City.** Its flag explainer was keyed under ISO's post-2016 code MX-CMX, while the app
uses Natural Earth's MX-DIF, so it never rendered. The entity was also named "Mexico", the country's
name, with the abolished type "Federal District". It is now "Mexico City", a Federal Entity, per
ISO 3166-2:MX and the 2016 reform. Venezuela's VE-A, named "Capital" (its card read "Capital of
Capital"), is now "Capital District" (ISO 3166-2:VE "Distrito Capital").

**New gate.** `check-flag-meanings.mjs` now fails on:
- a sub-national explainer whose code is not a `SUBDIVISION_META` code (E), which is how Mexico
  City's was lost;
- an explainer beside no flag (F): not indexed and not overridden, or suppressed.

Both branches were exercised: the old MX-CMX key fails E, and dropping GT-PE from the index fails F.

**For later:**
- Puerto Barrios: FOTW draws the stripes blue-white-green (gt-iz-pb), but the app and guatemala.com
  have green-white-blue. Settle the order from a photo or the municipality.
- Chiquimula city: the arms in the app's file differ from FOTW's 2008 drawing (gt-cq-cq). The
  layout matches.
- Baja Verapaz and Quiché, when a free file of the current flag exists.

## Batch 8b — findings from Codex's independent review of 30 September (F104–F106)

*Shipped in #1735 (`43d1594`); live since 1 October 2026, 3:51 AM AEST.*

Codex reviewed the 23 commits since `011e0065` and recorded its evidence in
`docs/audit/SUBNATIONAL_DELTA_VERIFICATION_2026-09-30.json`. Three findings concern this audit.

**F106 — Khmelnytskyi's capital flag had the wrong number of rays.** Batch 7e pinned "Flag of
Khmelnytskyi (3-2).svg", whose sun has 12 rays. The council's specification (decision No. 13 of 22
March 2017, khm.gov.ua "Символи міста") gives sixteen, and so did the explainer. Commons also holds
"Прапор Хмельницького.png", the council's own artwork: 180×120 and byte-identical to
khm.gov.ua/sites/default/files/flag_0.png (SHA-1 `c9795f19…`, the image Codex compared). That file
is now the capital flag. It is small, but it is the design the council adopted.

**F105 — Guyana's regional centres.**
- Region 4, Demerara-Mahaica: the map marked Georgetown, the national capital and a municipality of
  its own, and the capital card said Paradise (Wikidata's P36). Its Regional Democratic Council sits
  at Triumph:
  - DPI Guyana, "Substantial upgrades slated for Region Four roads, bridges": "The Region 4 RDC
    building in Triumph Housing Scheme, East Coast Demerara";
  - the Ministry of Education's *Social Studies Made Easy* table of regional democratic centres;
  - en.wikipedia's Triumph article, "Village and regional capital".
- Region 5, Mahaica-Berbice, showed no capital. Its centre is Fort Wellington (the same sources, and
  en.wikipedia "Mahaica-Berbice").

Both are pinned by Wikidata QID in both capital generators (Triumph Q6152928, at its preferred
P625; Fort Wellington Q2332581). NE's Georgetown is blocked as Region 4's capital; it is still the
region's largest city and the national capital. Populations are from Statistics Guyana's 2012
census, "Population by Sex" by village: Triumph 3,788 (Region 4, page 14), Fort Wellington 33
(Region 5, page 19). en.wikipedia's 118 for Fort Wellington includes the neighbouring Catherina's
Lust (85). The 2012 census is the latest village-level count found. Neither village has a flag.

**F104 — co-capitals, queued as SF-17.** Forlì-Cesena has had two capitals since decree-law 7 of
29 January 2024 (the province's own announcement; its legal offices stay in Forlì). Pesaro and
Urbino, the Azores, Appenzell Ausserrhoden and Tipperary have the same problem in other forms.
Batch 7d pinned one seat each so the map and the card agree. Showing every seat with its role needs
a list-valued subdivision capital, as national capitals already have.

F107, La Trinidad, is a caveat rather than an error. Codex read Republic Act 531 of 1950 but could
not open the NHCP heraldry page the explainer cites. Re-read on 1 October 2026: it is the blog the
National Historical Commission calls the "temporary home of NHCP's Philippine Government Seals",
and it gives every element the explainer states, including the kayabang basket and the sixteen
cogs for the sixteen barangays. The explainer stands.

## Batch 8c — the last 30 flags without an explainer: territories, de facto states, three cities

*Shipped in #1736 (`e095aa4`); live since 1 October 2026, 10:42 AM AEST.*

**What was wrong.** `subdiv-remaining.mjs` listed 30 shown subdivision flags with neither an
explainer nor a logged omission. Most were territories that the app shows under their sovereign or
claimant, using the territory's own flag. They include the British overseas territories and Crown
dependencies, Australia's and New Zealand's external territories, the Faroes, Åland, Taiwan and
Tibet under China, Kosovo under Serbia, Western Sahara under Morocco, and Northern Cyprus under
Cyprus and Türkiye. The Learn panel looks an explainer up by the subdivision code, so none rendered,
even for Taiwan and Montserrat, which had explainers under their two-letter codes. Paris, Érd and
New Taipei were the other three.

**Added (30), each read from its source:**
- The flags' own en.wikipedia articles, with FOTW for the Isle of Man's triskelion (Znamierowski).
- The Falklands' coat-of-arms article, for what the ram and the Desire stand for.
- Paris's coat-of-arms article, for the ship of the Marchands de l'eau.
- For Érd, the Hungarian Wikipedia's arms section, which cites the city's own heraldry page. For New
  Taipei, FOTW and the city government's logo page.
- Taiwan and Montserrat reuse their national explainers verbatim.
- Two myth-versus-fact entries. Kosovo's six stars are officially its six major ethnic groups; the
  "Greater Albania" reading is unofficial. The 2019 claim that Northern Cyprus's stripes are the Nile
  and the Euphrates is a debunked conspiracy theory; the flag law gives the stripes no meaning, and
  the common reading is labelled as one.
- Tibet's entry attributes the symbolism to the Central Tibetan Administration and states the flag's
  status. The Cocos (Keeling) entry says the Australian Government has not formally recognised the
  flag.

`subdiv-remaining.mjs` now reads remaining:0, and `npm run subdiv:audit-omissions` is clean. That
completes the sub-national flag-meaning sweep for the flags the app shows.

**Verified in the running app:** 15 of the 16 views probed render the new explainer beside a painted
flag, with myth-versus-fact blocks for Kosovo and Northern Cyprus. New Taipei's view does not open:
Taiwan has no Learn country panel. SF-16 now covers Taiwan as well as Saint Helena.

**For later:** the United Kingdom and Mauritius agreed in 2025 to transfer the Chagos Archipelago.
Once that transfer takes effect, re-check the British Indian Ocean Territory (GB-IO) under the
subdivision-research rule.

## Batch 8d — Norway's 2024 counties (2026-10-01)

*Shipped in #1737 (`438923f`); live since 1 October 2026, 11:58 AM AEST.*

**What was wrong.** The app's map of Norway still showed the 19 counties abolished in 2020. Eight of
them (Hedmark, Oppland, Aust-Agder, Vest-Agder, Hordaland, Sogn og Fjordane, Nord- and
Sør-Trøndelag) no longer exist. Seven others (Østfold, Akershus, Buskerud, Vestfold, Telemark, Troms
and Finnmark) were merged in 2020 and re-established on 1 January 2024, with new ISO codes (NO-31 to
NO-56) and changed borders.

The effect on flags:
- Only four county flags showed: Oslo, Rogaland, Møre og Romsdal and Nordland.
- Five more were bundled under the new codes, but nothing looked them up.
- Two of those five belonged to counties abolished in 2024: Vestfold og Telemark and Troms og
  Finnmark.

**The map.** `public/subdivisions/NO.json` now holds the 15 counties in force since 2024:
- **Source:** Kartverket's county boundaries clipped to the coastline, from robhop/fylker-og-kommuner
  (`Fylker-S.geojson`, "Oppdatert 2024", CC BY 4.0). The detail is about the same as before (16,529
  points against 15,871).
- **Carried over unchanged:** Svalbard and the Bouvet placeholder.
- **Format:** coordinates are rounded to 6 decimals and rings wound the way d3 expects, as in the
  app's other maps.

The geometry was checked against Kartverket's own API (`ws.geonorge.no/kommuneinfo`):
- **Counties:** every county lies inside its official county area. The parts outside are border
  slivers of 0.03–0.38% (Oslo, which is small, 1.24%).
- **Municipalities:** none of the 275 municipality reference points on land falls in the wrong county.
  The other 82 lie at sea, inside the municipality's legal area.
- **One wrong assumption caught:** Jevnaker joined Akershus, not Buskerud.

**Data re-keyed to the new counties:**
- **Meta:** regenerated.
- **Capitals:** `cities.ts` regenerated. Pinned:
  - Akershus → Oslo (outside the county);
  - Innlandet → Hamar;
  - Agder → Kristiansand;
  - Trøndelag → Steinkjer.

  Østfold → Sarpsborg, through the Wikidata fallback; Moss stays blocked.
- **Co-capitals (added to SF-17):** Agder's and Trøndelag's Wikidata items list two capitals each.
  - **Agder:** Kristiansand has the county hall (Fylkeshuset). Arendal has the state county governor
    and the county's postal address.
  - **Trøndelag:** the county's own site says "Administrasjonssenteret er Steinkjer". Trondheim hosts
    the county mayor.
- **County populations:** SSB table 07459, 1 January 2026. The 15 counties add up exactly to the
  national 5,627,400. Norway is added to `check-population-freshness.mjs`, both to the freshness floor
  and to the sum check.
- **Capital populations:** each capital's municipality, from SSB for 1 January 2026, which is the
  local-authority unit CLAUDE.md asks for. Wikidata's town items carried urban-settlement counts
  instead, some stale: Stavanger's from 2015, Tromsø's from 2017.
- **Removed:** the old-code aliases in `wikidata-subdivision-code-aliases.mjs`.
- **Capital flags:** re-keyed for Sarpsborg (NO-31), Oslo (NO-32) and Bergen (NO-46). Trondheim's is
  dropped, because Trøndelag's seat is Steinkjer. The Oslo quiz-twin group is re-keyed too.
- **Regenerated:** the world sub-national borders mesh.

**County flags: 12 of 15 shown.**

| County | Decision | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Oslo (NO-03) | Kept | Unchanged |
| Rogaland (NO-11) | Replaced | Commons redraw of the approved drawing, at FOTW's 4:5. The bundled file was 8:5 |
| Møre og Romsdal (NO-15) | Kept; open question | FOTW: the arms were never approved, and the flag "is said to be" the shield on white. No current source says which flag is flown |
| Nordland (NO-18) | Kept | The 1965 regulation gives the flag the same design as the arms |
| Østfold (NO-31), Akershus (NO-32), Buskerud (NO-33) | New | Readopted in 2024 (FOTW `no-viken`, `no-01`, `no-02`, `no-06`). The Commons files are redraws of the National Archives' approved drawings and cite Lovdata. Akershus's regulation reads "I blått en hvit trappegavl" |
| Vestfold (NO-39) | New | The same blazon, readopted and redrawn in 2024 (no.wikipedia, FOTW `no-07`). The image is the 1970 drawing |
| Agder (NO-42) | New | A banner of the 2018 arms, using the same tree drawing as the official arms file. FOTW `no-agder`; a Lindesnes Avis screenshot credited to Agder county |
| Trøndelag (NO-50) | Replaced | The bundled file had no white field. Steinkjerleksikonet: "Gult kors mot hvit bakgrunn er Trøndelag sitt fylkesvåpen og -flagg" |
| Troms (NO-55), Finnmark (NO-56) | New | Readopted in 2024 (FOTW `no-19`, `no-20`; no.wikipedia, "Finnmark beholder fylkesvåpenet") |
| Innlandet (NO-34) | Withheld | The flag is the arms shield on dark green (FOTW `no-inn`, the 2022 design manual). The only free file is an undocumented banner of the arms |
| Telemark (NO-40) | Withheld | The 2024 flag is the redrawn, round-bottomed arms on yellow (county design manual: "Fylkesflagget består av fylkesvåpenet på gul bakgrunn"). Commons has only the 1970–2019 banner |
| Vestland (NO-46) | Withheld | No county flag (FOTW `no-vest`, November 2024; the county's arms page). Wikidata's flag is a 2025 Commons upload copied from vexilla-mundi, which documents nothing |

**How the files were bundled:**
- **Format:** Commons PNG renders through `thumb.php`, at each original's exact ratio.
  upload.wikimedia.org answered 429 with a 10-minute retry-after.
- **Removed or replaced:** the SVGs for NO-34, NO-38, NO-46 and NO-54 were removed; NO-11 and NO-50
  were replaced.
- **Drift job:** the download script no longer lists the replaced codes, so the weekly drift job
  cannot bring them back.
- **Suppressed:** NO-34, NO-40 and NO-46 are in `SUPPRESSED_SUBDIVISION_FLAGS`, with the reasons above.

**Explainers.**
- **Eight new:** Østfold, Akershus, Buskerud, Vestfold, Agder, Trøndelag, Troms and Finnmark. They
  come from no.wikipedia's county-arms articles, FOTW and Steinkjerleksikonet.
- **Nordland, corrected:** "midnight-sun summers" was not in the source, which says the gold refers to
  the sun.
- **Møre og Romsdal, corrected:** "granted 1978" now reads that the county council adopted the arms in
  1978 and they were never formally approved.

**Also in this batch.** Saransk's capital flag (RU-MO) is re-encoded from UTF-16 to UTF-8. This is a
byte-level change; the image is the same. `check-capital-flags.mjs` can now read the file, so it is
no longer skipped.

**For later:**
- **Batch 8e, Norway's county-seat capital flags.** Ten seats have municipal flags on their
  municipality items in Wikidata (P41): Stavanger, Molde, Bodø, Drammen, Hamar, Skien, Kristiansand,
  Steinkjer, Tromsø and Vadsø. The town items, which the capital pipeline reads, carry none.
  Tønsberg's municipality item carries no flag either.
- **Møre og Romsdal:** find out which flag the county actually flies.
- **Innlandet and Telemark:** show their flags once a free file of the documented design exists.

## Batch 8e — capital flags for Norway's county seats (SF-18, 2026-10-01)

*Shipped in #1738 (`081f2de`); live since 1 October 2026, 1:03 PM AEST.*

**What was wrong.** Only three Norwegian county capitals showed a flag: Sarpsborg, Oslo and Bergen.
The capital pipeline reads each capital's town item on Wikidata, and the Norwegian town items carry
no flag (P41). The flags belong to the municipality items. Batch 8d's research found them.

**Added (7), each checked against FOTW and a primary record:**
- **Stavanger:** a gold vine on blue. Arms and flag were approved by royal resolution in 1939, and the
  merged municipality kept its symbols in 2020 (FOTW `no-11-03`).
- **Bodø:** a gold sun on red, for the midnight sun. Arms and flag date from 1959 (Lovdata
  1959-07-24-1; the Commons file is redrawn from the National Archives' approved drawing).
- **Drammen:** the city flag adopted on 9 July 1930, a wavy white stripe on blue for the river (FOTW
  `no-06-02`). Drammens Tidende reported in 2019 that the merger committee had overlooked the flag.
  FOTW records (December 2024) that the merged municipality kept its symbols.
- **Hamar:** a black grouse on a pine, on white. The design dates from 1896, and arms and flag were
  approved in 1993 (Lovdata 1993-07-09-648).
- **Steinkjer:** since the 2020 merger the new municipality uses Verran's arms and flag, a white boat
  on blue (FOTW `no-17-02`, `no-17-24`). Steinkjer's own six-pointed star is retired.
- **Tromsø:** a white reindeer on blue. Arms and flag date from 1983 (Lovdata 1983-07-22-1290).
- **Vadsø:** a white reindeer's head on red. Arms and flag date from 1976 (FOTW `no-20-03`).

Each is pinned in `CAPITAL_FLAG_SOURCE_OVERRIDES` with these reasons, and each has a sourced
explainer. For Stavanger, the explainer says that what the vine means is not known.

**How the files were bundled:**
- **Stavanger:** the Commons original, verified against its SHA-1.
- **The other six:** Commons `thumb.php` renders at the originals' exact ratios.
  upload.wikimedia.org answered 429 for these rarely requested files for over half an hour, while
  serving cached ones. Bodø and Tromsø are SVG renders; Drammen, Hamar and Vadsø are at half size;
  Steinkjer (Verran's GIF) is at 215 pixels square.
- **Tromsø:** the render's last row was translucent anti-aliasing from a fractional height. Trimming it
  restores the exact 512:372 ratio.

**Not shown (4):**
- **Molde:** FOTW is unsure what the town flies (the arms on white, perhaps). The only file is a 2026
  own work with no source.
- **Skien:** FOTW's only image is a municipal logo flag from a 2011 profile guide, and FOTW itself
  doubts the source. A logo is not a city flag.
- **Kristiansand:** the only Commons file is the 17th-century flag, which the file itself calls no
  longer in use. FOTW pairs it with the city, but no source documents the flag flown today.
- **Tønsberg:** the municipality took new arms when it merged with Re in 2020. No current flag is
  documented, and Commons has no file.

## Batch 8f — Malta's local councils without a flag (SF-06, 2026-10-01)

*Shipped in #1739 (`9bd66b6`); live since 1 October 2026, 10:55 PM AEST.*

**What was wrong.** The app showed flags for 56 of Malta's 68 local councils. The other 12 had never
been bundled, though most of them fly a banner of their arms.

**The standard.** Sir Adrian Strickland, quoted on FOTW's Malta page (`mt-.html`): each local council
"has its own coat of arms and the flag of that Council is a banner of the arms, the dimensions of
which vary". City coronets appear as finials, not on the banner. The other 56 are shown that way, and
it is the test used here: a Commons file is used only when it draws the council's banner of arms as
FOTW documents it. Each file keeps its drawn ratio, as the other 56 do. FOTW also quotes a local book
giving 3:5 for these banners, but Strickland says the dimensions vary.

**Added (9).** Each is the Commons banner of arms, compared with FOTW's image of the flag:
- **Birżebbuġa (MT-05):** white, a blue inverted chevron and a blue olive branch (FOTW `mt-15`). This
  is the council's second flag; the first was blue with a gold chain and two crossed keys. The
  Commons file is a 2023 own work, and it matches FOTW's description, which comes from images in a
  local book.
- **Kerċem (MT-22):** a red fess with three gold rings, on white (FOTW `mt-30`).
- **Kirkop (MT-23):** a red fess and pale, on white (FOTW `mt-31`).
- **Lija (MT-24):** an orange branch with three oranges between a red and a blue canton (FOTW
  `mt-32`). These are the current arms, not the older orange-tree drawing.
- **Luqa (MT-25):** a red saltire on white (FOTW `mt-33`).
- **Marsa (MT-26):** per pale, blue-and-white and red-and-white stripes, with a gold ship (FOTW
  `mt-34`).
- **Marsaskala (MT-27):** green, with a white wedge carrying blue wavy lines (FOTW `mt-35`; seen
  flying at the bay in 2008).
- **Mdina (MT-29):** white and red, divided vertically (FOTW `mt-02`; seen flying in 2000). Its
  perceptual distance to Malta's national flag is 106; the parent-flag check fails below 12.
- **Mellieħa (MT-30):** blue, a gold chevron and a white six-pointed star (FOTW `mt-37`; seen at the
  town hall in 2008).

**Explainers (4).**
- **Birżebbuġa:** the olive branch, for the village's olive growing (Hartemink, quoted by FOTW), and
  the name, "well of olives".
- **Marsaskala:** the bay between green land (FOTW).
- **Mdina:** Malta's white and red. The Count Roger story is shown as a myth, following Wikipedia's
  *Flag of Malta*.
- **Mellieħa:** King David's star and the Virgin Mary's blue, from the council's 1994 booklet on its
  arms, as quoted by FOTW.

Kerċem, Kirkop, Lija, Luqa and Marsa have only a bare blazon on FOTW. Their English and Maltese
Wikipedia articles give no meaning either, so they are logged as omissions.

**How the files were bundled.** These are Commons `thumb.php` PNG renders, because upload.wikimedia.org
and the Commons API answered 429 throughout. Kerċem's file is drawn at 36:25 (720×500) and is kept so.
Birżebbuġa is rendered at 1024×683, the size nearest its drawn ratio.

**Not shown (3):**
- **Kalkara (MT-21):** since 2009 the flag is yellow over blue, with a flame rising from the dividing
  line and a green border (FOTW `mt-29`, from the council's notice). Commons holds the 1993–2009 flag,
  plus a 2025 own work with no source that draws the shield on a green field, which is a different
  design.
- **Marsaxlokk (MT-28):** the only Commons file draws the saltire violet (`#5200FF`). The blazon is
  *Argent, a saltire Azure*. FOTW's banner is blue, and the flag seen flying in 2008 had a light-blue
  saltire. The Commons arms drawn from the government's images are blue as well. The saltire's colour
  is all that tells this flag apart from Luqa's, so the violet file is withheld.
- **Paola (MT-39):** the current flag, adopted on 20 July 1996, is white with a red chief carrying
  three spirals, and three peacocks on sheaves below. It exists only as FOTW's image, which English
  Wikipedia uses under fair use. Commons has only the 1994–1996 spiral flag.

**Verified in the running app:** the 9 flags paint, the 4 explainers render (Mdina with its myth-versus-fact section), and the
three withheld councils show neither a flag nor an explainer. No page errors, and no remote flag requests.

**For later:** show Kalkara, Marsaxlokk and Paola once free files of their current designs exist.
Malta's councils, like 259 subdivisions in 28 countries, show the generic type "Division". This is logged as
SF-19 in the handbook.

## Batch 8g — the British Indian Ocean Territory's 2025 flag (Codex F108, 2026-10-01)

*Shipped in #1740 (`eacf690`); live since 1 October 2026, 11:10 PM AEST.*

**What was wrong.** Codex's finding F108: batch 8c's explainer for the British Indian Ocean Territory
(GB-IO) described a Tudor Crown, but the bundled flag (`public/flags/io.svg`, from hampusborgos) still
showed St Edward's Crown with red velvet and jewels. The BIOT administration's flag page
(biot.gov.io/governance/flag-and-crest/) says the flag "was formally updated in October 2025 via
submission to His Majesty, in agreement with the College of Arms". King Charles III's Tudor Crown,
"simple gold, unadorned by red velvet or jewels", replaced Queen Elizabeth II's St Edward's Crown.
hampusborgos still carries the 1990 crown.

**What changed:**
- **The current flag.** `public/flags/io.svg` is now the Commons file *Flag of the British Indian
  Ocean Territory 2025.svg*. It is public domain, sourced to the UK government's flag guide and the
  BIOT site, and the plain Commons filename now redirects to it. Compared side by side with the
  administration's own artwork (`BIOT-Flag-Tudor-Crown.jpg`), it has the same plain gold Tudor
  Crown, with no red velvet or jewels.
- **The downloader.** `download-flags.mjs` pins that file, so a forced re-download cannot bring back
  the old crown.
- **National symbols.** The current flag is now dated from 2025, with the administration's page as
  its source and a sourced explainer. The 1990–2025 flag is now a historical entry: Commons *Flag
  of the British Indian Ocean Territory 1990.svg*, near-identical to the file it replaces (mean
  pixel difference 1.3 of 255).
- **The GB-IO explainer.** It now says the 1990 grant carried St Edward's Crown and that the Tudor
  Crown came in 2025. It cites the administration's page.

GB-IO shares `io.svg` with the IO world-map entity and the National symbols tab, so all three now
show the 2025 flag.

**Verified in the running app:**
- The GB-IO panel paints the 2025 flag, gold Tudor Crown, with the corrected explainer.
- The UK's sub-national National symbols tab lists the 2025 flag as current ("2025 – present") and
  the 1990 flag under Historical flags. Both images paint.
- No page errors and no remote flag requests.

## Batch 8h — Moldova's 37 official units (SF-06, 2026-10-01)

*Shipped in #1741 (`e99f6ac`); live since 1 October 2026, 11:31 PM AEST.*

**What was wrong.** None of Moldova's divisions showed a flag, and the map behind them was wrong:
- **Mis-coded units.** The file carried 40 Natural Earth features: two copies each of Transnistria
  (MD-SN) and Rezina, and Camenca (MD-CAM) and Grigoriopol (MD-GRI) as separate units, though
  neither is an ISO 3166-2 division.
- **A missing district.** Dubăsari district (MD-DU) was absent.
- **A misnamed region.** Gagauzia (MD-GA) was called "Comrat", its capital, so its card read
  "Capital of Comrat".
- **Wrong capitals.** Transnistria's capital was Dubăsari. Bender's was Tiraspol, so Bender's
  capital card showed no population.

**The map.** `public/subdivisions/MD.json` is now the OCHA/UNHCR boundary set for Moldova
(Humanitarian Data Exchange `cod-ab-mda`, ADM1, CC BY-IGO, valid from 10 May 2022, resource updated
26 January 2026, zip SHA-256 `05446de3…63fc`). It has exactly the 37 ISO 3166-2:MD units:
- 32 districts;
- Chișinău, Bălți and Bender (ISO "city");
- Gagauzia (autonomous territorial unit);
- the left bank of the Dniester (territorial unit), shown as Transnistria.

Coordinates are kept as published, rounded to 6 dp (the source carries float noise beyond that),
and rings are rewound to d3's convention. Every unit's area is within 2% of the source's own
`area_sqkm`. The meta is regenerated, and so is the world sub-national border mesh.

**Capitals:**
- **Transnistria → Tiraspol.** The Natural Earth point now falls in the right polygon. The
  left-bank unit's Wikidata item has no capital, so `CAPITAL_CITY_QIDS` pins Tiraspol (Q132572).
- **Bender → Bender.** This is Wikidata's capital of the Bender municipality item.
- **Dubăsari → Cocieri.** Wikidata P36; English Wikipedia: "Administrative center … Cocieri". The
  town of Dubăsari is held by the Transnistrian authorities.

The two Wikidata-fallback rows (Bender, Cocieri) were added by hand. Re-running
`build-subdivision-capitals.mjs` would also rewrite 17 other countries' rows from today's Wikidata,
including a vandalised label that renames Algeria's Khenchela "tangier". That regeneration is left
for a reviewed pass of its own.

**Populations.** The 2024 census final results (NBS, published 26 March 2026,
`Anexa_Localitati_RPL2024.xlsx`, table 8.2) match every district figure the app already carried.
Dubăsari district is new at 21,781, replacing a 2014 figure under a code that had no map unit.
Cocieri's capital card shows 2,943 (2024 census; table 8.3 and Wikidata agree). Tiraspol's shows
133,807 (Wikidata's latest dated statement, 1 January 2014). The Camenca and Grigoriopol rows are
removed.

**Flags (new entities made complete):**
- **Transnistria (MD-SN).** The state flag of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic
  (Commons *Flag of Transnistria (state).svg*; public domain under the PMR's 1994 regulation),
  checked against FOTW `md-dnies`. Under Moldova it is labelled "Flag not officially recognised by
  Moldova", exactly as Abkhazia is under Georgia. It carries a neutral disputed note, sourced to
  Wikipedia's *Political status of Transnistria*: recognised only by Abkhazia and South Ossetia,
  and internationally recognised as part of Moldova. The explainer notes that the state flag law
  gives the symbols no meaning.
- **Gagauzia (MD-GA).** The flag set out in its 1995 law and Organic Law (Commons *Flag of
  Gagauzia.svg*, PD-MD-exempt), checked against FOTW `md-gagau`. The explainer gives the
  published interpretations as interpretations.
- **Dubăsari district (MD-DU).** Blue-white-blue with a red *dubas* boat, approved in 2004 (FOTW
  `md-db`; Commons *Dubăsari District flag.svg*, a thumb.php render at its own 8:5).
- **Tiraspol (capital of MD-SN).** The 2002 city flag (Commons *Flag of Tiraspol.svg*, a render at
  its drawn ratio), checked against FOTW `md-tira`. The explainer is from Russian Wikipedia's
  *Флаг Тирасполя*.

Cocieri has no flag on Wikidata, Commons or FOTW's Moldova index, so its capital card shows none.

**Verified in the running app:**
- The Moldova map draws 37 units; Camenca, Grigoriopol and "Comrat" are gone.
- The grid groups 32 districts, 3 cities, Gagauzia and Transnistria. Transnistria is labelled
  "Flag not officially recognised by Moldova".
- Panels for Transnistria, Gagauzia, Dubăsari and Bender show their capitals with populations, and
  the new flags and explainers paint.
- No page errors and no remote flag requests.

**For later (batch 8i and beyond):**
- **District and city flags.** Moldova's 31 other district flags and the flags of Chișinău, Bălți
  and Bender. FOTW has a page for every district (`md-sub.html`), and their capital-town flags are
  already bundled.
- **Transnistria's and Bender's populations.** MD-SN still shows the Pridnestrovian total of
  367,776 (Wikidata, 2024), which includes Bender. MD-BD shows 98,726 labelled as the 2014 census,
  but Moldova's 2014 census did not enumerate Bender. Both need re-sourcing from the PMR statistics
  service with the unit's scope matched.

## Batch 8i — Moldova's district and municipal flags (SF-06, 2026-10-01)

**What was wrong.** After batch 8h only Transnistria, Gagauzia and Dubăsari district had flags. The
other 31 districts and the municipalities of Chișinău and Bălți showed none, though FOTW documents a
flag for nearly every one. Chișinău, Bălți and Bender showed no flag anywhere. They are city
territories, so their capital cards hide the capital flag as a duplicate of the division's, and
their division slot was empty.

**Added (29).** Each is the Commons file named by the unit's own Wikidata item (P41), compared
side by side with FOTW's image of the flag on that district's page (index `md-sub.html`):
- **Districts:** Anenii Noi, Basarabeasca, Cahul, Călărași, Cantemir, Căușeni, Cimișlia, Criuleni,
  Dondușeni, Drochia, Edineț, Fălești, Florești, Ialoveni, Leova, Nisporeni, Orhei, Rezina,
  Rîșcani, Sîngerei, Soroca, Strășeni, Șoldănești, Ștefan Vodă, Taraclia, Telenești and Ungheni.
- **Municipalities:**
  - Chișinău, the design the city adopted in 2020: narrow yellow stripes, with the small arms
    uncrowned. It replaced the 1998 flag with the twisted braid.
  - Bălți, the flag of 2006.

Where Commons and FOTW differ only in shade (Edineț, Ialoveni, Sîngerei, Taraclia), it is the same
design drawn twice.

**How they were bundled.** Each file is used at the size its Commons original was drawn. The Commons
API answered 429, so sizes and SHA-1s came from the Toolforge Commons API:
- **17 GIFs:** byte-identical originals (SHA-1 matched), fetched through `thumb.php` at their exact
  width and converted losslessly to PNG. Most are 195–324 px wide, from 2010.
- **6 PNG/JPG files:** Commons' render at the original's exact size, because the upload server
  rate-limited every uncached file (Basarabeasca, Cimișlia, Drochia, Căușeni, Leova, Taraclia).
- **Bălți:** rendered at 1,200 px from its 3,001 px original.
- **5 drawn as SVGs:** 900 px renders (Cahul, Chișinău, Rezina, Soroca, Ungheni).

A first attempt bundled every flag as a 900 px `thumb.php` render. `thumb.php` turned out to
enlarge rasters (a 225×150 GIF came back at 600×400), so those blurry enlargements were replaced
before commit.

**Explainers (4):**
- **Chișinău:** the city's own symbols page, which says the flag stands for the past, present and
  future of the community.
- **Bălți:** canting arms (*baltă*, a pond) and the archer of 1930 (FOTW and ro.wikipedia).
- **Florești:** the canting flower, from FOTW, quoting Moldpres and Presidential Decree No. 1242 of
  2019.
- **Strășeni:** the 1826 oak and the wine barrels (FOTW, quoting the district council).

The other districts are logged as omissions in `subdiv-meaning-omitted.txt`. FOTW gives each one's
adoption date, author or blazon but no meaning. Every district's Romanian Wikipedia article was
read, and all show the arms with no explanation.

**Not shown:**
- **Briceni:** FOTW `md-br`: "The District of Briceni doesn't have its own flag and is using the
  flag of the Town of Briceni." The town's flag is already its capital flag.
- **Glodeni:** new symbols were registered in 2016, after Moldova's heraldic commission objected
  that the ox was too like the one on the national arms (FOTW `md-gl`). FOTW draws the current flag
  with a gold aurochs head. The only Commons file has a brown head of a different shape, which
  matches neither the 2016 drawing nor the 2014 one. Withheld until the file can be checked against
  the 2016 decree.
- **Hîncești:** the flag is verified: Commons' SVG matches FOTW `md-hn`, a gold bow, arrow and vine
  leaves on red. But the SVG source could not be fetched (upload.wikimedia.org answered 429 for
  every uncached file for over an hour), and the design is too sparse for the raster image-quality
  gate (detail 4.3, minimum 5). It will be added as an SVG once the file can be fetched.
- **Ocnița:** the only Commons file is a 225×150 GIF. The flag, a thin sword between ears of wheat
  on red, is so sparse that at raster size the image-quality gate cannot tell it from a blank stub
  (detail 4.9, minimum 5). Withheld until a vector file exists; the gate is not lowered.
- **Bender:** the city's flag (yellow over black, with the eagle and the lion; FOTW `md-bend`) is
  the design used by the Transnistrian-administered city council. It is bundled as Bender's capital
  flag, but hidden like the other city territories'. Showing it as the division flag needs a
  sourced decision on how to label it, as Transnistria's has. That is a follow-up.

**Verified in the running app:**
- All 32 Moldovan division flags in the grid paint (`img.complete && naturalWidth > 0`). Briceni,
  Glodeni, Hîncești and Ocnița show none.
- Chișinău and Bălți show their flag once, with the new explainers, and their capital cards add no
  second copy.
- Florești and Strășeni render their FOTW-sourced explainers.
- No page errors and no remote flag requests. `flags:check` and `npm run build` pass.

## Follow-ups (later batches)

### Capital flags that match another place's flag (found in batch 5)
The identical-flag scan was also run on capital flags against every other flag of the same
country. It found 46 identical pairs, in three groups:
- **One city, two subdivisions.** Kyiv, Budapest, Minsk, Oslo, Port Moresby, Honiara, Bishkek,
  Damascus, Addis Ababa, Sofia, and the Hungarian county seats that are also cities with county
  rights. The city is the capital of one subdivision and a division in its own right. A mixed deck
  should accept both answers.
- **Different places with the same design.** Probably right, but each needs checking: Genoa and
  Milan (St George's cross), Warsaw and Łódź (yellow over red), Munich and Baden-Württemberg
  (black and gold), and several Italian provincial capitals with the same bicolour.
- **Wrong data.** North Sulawesi and Schellenberg were fixed in batch 6a. Taza and Beni Mellal
  both use the Fes *province* flag; see Morocco below.
- **Checked and right.** České Budějovice's flag is yellow over red, like Prague's (Czech
  Wikipedia). Lons-le-Saunier's is red and yellow (FOTW fr-39-ls, 2021).
- **Still to check.** Grenoble's red-and-yellow file on Commons has no source for its design, and
  FOTW (fr-38-gr, 2001) describes the flag as red and white. Also Caserta and Catania, Brescia and
  Isernia, Ibagué and Bolívar, and Zamora and Esmeraldas.
- **Resolved in batch 6b** (see above): every pair is now either grouped with sources, recorded as
  distinct, or removed because its flag was wrong.

### The quiz does not check capital names (found in batch 6a)
The Learn panel shows a capital's flag only when the capital card and the map name the same city.
The capital quiz uses the card's name alone. So each of the 25 mismatches logged in
`capital-meaning-omitted.txt` reaches the quiz with the card's city. Examples: Singaraja for Bali,
Bau-Bau for Southeast Sulawesi, Pahandut for Central Kalimantan, and Trogen for Appenzell
Ausserrhoden. Some are spelling only (Gent/Ghent, Luzern/Lucerne, Dumyat/Damietta). Others are
real disagreements, and sometimes the map is the one that is out of date: South Kalimantan's
capital moved from Banjarmasin to Banjarbaru in 2022. This is the capital-name reconciliation
below, and the quiz should apply the same check.

### Morocco (found in batch 6a)
The map has the 16 regions abolished in 2015, under the pre-2015 ISO codes. The capital data was
resolved against the 2015 codes, so MA-02 shows Oujda (for Gharb-Chrarda-Béni Hssen), MA-05 Beni
Mellal (for Fès-Boulemane), and so on. Every Moroccan capital flag is a *province* flag
(Kénitra, Fès, Settat, …), not a city's. This needs one structural fix, not per-code patches.



### City-territory capital cards (found in batch 4)
The Learn panel's capital card for a city-territory shows the territory's own figure for Kuala
Lumpur and Washington, but "No further sourced data" for Prague, Seoul and Busan. The city *is*
the territory, so the card should show the territory's population. `CAPITAL_POPULATION_OVERRIDES`
can only fill an existing record, so these need a record-creating path. Seoul's and Busan's
figures should also wait for Korea's 2025 census refresh.

### Capital-name reconciliation (found in batch 3)
The capital widget shows the capital from `cityRoles` (Natural Earth, placed by point-in-polygon).
Its population and flag come from Wikidata `P36`, keyed by ISO code. A name check already hides the
population and flag when the two capitals disagree, but the **local name** was never checked. In
**255** subdivisions the two names differ:
- **About 127 are the same city spelled differently** (Bamian/Bamyan, Gent/Ghent, Homyel/Gomel).
  For these the check wrongly hides a real population and flag.
- **About 128 are different cities.** Some come from the ISO-code generation mix in Iran and
  Morocco. Others are seat districts (Beijing → Tongzhou, Taipei → Xinyi, Tokyo → Shinjuku). Others
  are Natural Earth putting the capital in the wrong city:
  - ~~Eritrea's four regions are shifted by one;~~ the map outlines were rotated; fixed in 7b;
  - Greece: Kavala for Komotini, Chalkida for Lamia, Kalamata for Tripoli;
  - ~~Afghanistan: Paktia and Paktika are swapped;~~ the map codes were swapped; fixed in 7b;
  - Ethiopia: Dese for Bahir Dar, Jima for Addis Ababa;
  - A Coruña is given as Santiago;
  - Azerbaijan's Zangilan is given as Kapan, a town in Armenia.

  These need a sourced capital-correction layer and a local-name check.

### Gaps — real flags the app shows blank

These have an official flag documented by Wikidata `P41` and the local-language Wikipedia, but show
nothing. Mostly this is an ISO-code mismatch between the flag data and the app's codes.

### Explainers
The 35 curated-override flags listed in §5.

### Judgement areas to settle
- **French departments.** No department has an official flag. The app shows a mix of council logo
  flags and heraldic flags, some of them Commons proposals (`Proposed flag of Doubs.svg`, FR-65 is
  `{{fictitious flag}}`). This needs a policy decision before any change.
- **Mexican states.** Most use the arms on white de facto; only a few are official. Colima's Commons
  file is `{{fictitious flag}}`. Consider an "unofficial" label rather than removal.
- **Paraguay.** PY-12 Ñeembucú and PY-16 Alto Paraguay have two different designs across sources
  (ours vs es.wikipedia), and FOTW has no image. PY-1 Concepción lacks the arms that FOTW's flag
  carries.
- **El Salvador and Honduras** departments whose flag equals the capital's (FOTW says Comayagua's
  department uses its capital's flag). Review them against the Nicaragua and Portugal rule.
- **GE-AB Abkhazia** shows the Republic of Abkhazia flag labelled unofficial, as CLAUDE.md
  specifies. Georgia's own Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia flag (Georgian cross canton) exists and
  could be mentioned in the note.

### Structural data found in passing (not flag images)
- ~~**Iran**: IR-14/22/23 carry shifted ISO codes, so "Hormozgan" is keyed as Tehran.~~ Fixed in
  batch 7a: every province was affected, and the map now carries the current codes.
- ~~**Guyana**: GY-ES is mis-coded.~~ Eight of the ten regions were; fixed in batch 7b.
- **Latvia**: divisions are pre-2021 municipalities, and many old codes are named "Valmiera".
- **Vietnam**: provinces were merged in June 2025.
- **Indonesia**: six provinces created in 2022 are missing.
- ~~**Norway**: counties changed in 2024.~~ Fixed in batch 8d.
- **Nepal**: the zones were dissolved in 2015.
- **Kenya**: pre-2013 provinces.
- **Luxembourg**: districts were abolished in 2015.
- **Ethiopia**: SNNPR split in 2023.
- **Sardinia**: provinces restructured in 2016–2025.
- **Bosnia**: the ten cantons could carry their ISO codes BA-01…BA-10.
- **Deep links**: `?sub=` uppercases its value, so name-keyed divisions such as Posavina cannot be
  deep-linked.

### Capital-city flags
Batch 1 fixed only the knock-on effects above. A systematic comparison of `capitalFlags.ts` with
each capital's own Wikidata `P41` is a separate batch. Malaysia (batch 2) showed what to look for:
a capital given its **district's** flag (Kuala Terengganu) or a **traditional chiefdom's** flag
(Seremban). Commons file pages that say "district" are the first thing to sweep for.
