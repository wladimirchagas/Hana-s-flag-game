# Sub-national and capital-city flag audit — handbook

This is the entry point for anyone joining the sub-national flag audit, human or agent. It says what
the audit is for, how the work is done, which tools exist, what has shipped, and which work is open
to claim. It does not repeat the evidence. Every decision, with its sources, is in the ledger.

## 1. Goals

The audit is done when all six hold for every country.

1. **The right entity's flag.** Each subdivision card shows that subdivision's own flag. It must
   not show its capital city's flag, a coat of arms, seal or logo, a Commons fantasy, or the flag of
   a same-named place in another country.
2. **The right capital-city flag.** "View capital" shows the city's own municipal flag. It must not
   show the national flag, a district's, a chiefdom's or a province's flag, a design recorded as
   superseded, or a drawing no source documents.
3. **Complete where a real flag exists.** A subdivision with a documented flag shows it. Every
   bundled flag has a sourced "What this flag means" explainer, or its absence is logged after the
   FOTW check.
4. **Consistent entity data.** Code, name, type, capital, population and flag describe the same
   place. ISO code changes and swapped codes break all of them at once.
5. **A fair quiz.** Every Sub-national flags question has one right answer, or the game accepts
   every answer that flies the identical flag.
6. **Shipped.** Each batch is merged, confirmed live with `scripts/check-live-build.mjs`, and
   recorded in the ledger.

**Scope.** In: subdivision flags (`public/flags/sub/**`, `LOCAL_FLAG_OVERRIDES`); capital-city flags
(`public/capital-flags/**`); their explainers (`src/data/flagMeanings.ts`,
`src/data/cityFlagMeanings.ts`); the data behind them (`src/lib/subdivisionMeta.ts`,
`src/data/capitalDetails.ts`, `src/data/subdivisionCapitals.ts`); the Sub-national flags quiz.
Out: national flags and the National symbols tab, historical eras, map geometry, and the media,
bank, party and index datasets. Other agents cover those in the shared log.

## 2. Rules

Read these `CLAUDE.md` sections before changing anything. They are hard rules, and each exists
because the bug it describes shipped:

- "A subdivision's flag must be ITS OWN flag"
- "Never trust a bulk-imported subdivision flag"
- "Capital-city flags: never blindly trust P41"
- "A capital-city flag must never duplicate its own subdivision's flag"
- "A newly added or newly surfaced entity must be COMPLETE"
- "Every newly bundled flag MUST get a flag-meaning search"
- "Capital-city flag-meaning explainer — exhaust every language"
- "Flag-meaning explanations must be sourced"
- "All flag files must be bundled"
- "Flag aspect ratios", and "Mandatory visual verification"
- "PR workflow", including the live check

In short: never invent a flag, a date, a capital or a meaning. A missing flag is better than a wrong
one. Read the file page before trusting a file. Record every decision where the next person will
find it.

## 3. Method — one country at a time

### Step 1: list what the app shows
For the country, list the division codes and names (`SUBDIVISION_META`), each division's flag file,
each capital (`capitalDetails.ts`) and each capital flag (`capitalFlags.ts`). Then run
`node scripts/flag-audit/wikidata-subdivision.mjs <codes…>`. It prints the app's view next to
Wikidata's item for the same ISO code. When the two names disagree, investigate that first. The
problem is usually a code, not a flag.

### Step 2: gather references, in this order
1. **FOTW** (crwflags.com). Open the country's index (`it.html`, `it-reg.html`, `it-muni.html`,
   `co-.html` and so on) and follow its links. Never guess a filename. FOTW is often the only source
   that says a flag does not exist ("There is no known flag for…"). It also records variants and old
   errors, such as Lons-le-Saunier's colours being reported swapped in 2004.
2. **The local-language Wikipedia article**, read in full, not the summary. The flag is often
   described in a section below the lead: *Bandiera/Simboli*, *Bandera*, *Vlajka*, *Flaga*,
   *Flagge*, *Blason*. Use `scripts/flag-audit/wiki-raw.sh`.
3. **The official site** (region, province, comune or alcaldía). It outranks both of the above when
   it is current. Zamora's municipality settled its white-over-green flag against FOTW's 2001
   white-over-black.
4. **The Wikimedia Commons file page** (`scripts/flag-audit/commons-file.sh`). Read the description
   before trusting the image.

### Step 3: compare by eye
Put the bundled image next to each reference with `scripts/flag-audit/montage.mjs`, then look at
it. Filenames, hashes and pixel scores find candidates, but none of them decides.

### Step 4: decide, then change every file the decision touches

| Decision | Files to change |
|---|---|
| **Replace a division flag** | New file in `public/flags/sub/CC/CODE.ext`; entry in `public/flags/sources.json` (sorted, indent 2); `FLAG_CODES`/`NON_SVG_EXT` in `src/lib/subdivisionFlagIndex.ts` (keep sorted); `node scripts/build-flag-aspect-ratios.mjs`; explainer or logged omission |
| **Suppress a division flag** | Delete the file; remove it from the index and from `sources.json`; add the code, with a comment, to `SUPPRESSED_SUBDIVISION_FLAGS` in `src/api/subdivisions.ts`; remove its explainer from `flagMeanings.ts` (the panel shows an explainer even with no flag); regenerate aspect ratios |
| **Reject a capital flag** | Add `{file, reason}` to `scripts/data/capital-flag-rejected.json`; delete the code from `scripts/data/capital-flag-sources.json` and `src/data/capitalFlags.ts`; `git rm public/capital-flags/code.*`; remove the `cityFlagMeanings.ts` entry and any `capital-meaning-omitted.txt` line |
| **Wrong capital** (Wikidata P36) | `scripts/data/wikidata-capital-rejected.json`, or pin the right city in `CAPITAL_CITY_QIDS` (`scripts/build-capital-details.mjs`); mirror the change in the generated files |
| **Map capital spelled differently from its Wikidata item** (the panel hides the population and flag) | A row in `SUBNATIONAL_NAME_ALIAS` (`scripts/build-cities.mjs`), keyed `CODE|NE name` and citing the capital's QID; then `node scripts/build-cities.mjs`. For the same city only; a different city goes in `SUBNATIONAL_OVERRIDE` with a reason |
| **Map capital is a different city** (Natural Earth tags the wrong one) | If Natural Earth has the right city, add it to `SUBNATIONAL_OVERRIDE`. If not, add the code to `NE_CAPITAL_BLOCK`, so the Wikidata fallback supplies it. Either way cite the QID, then `node scripts/build-cities.mjs` and the fallback generator into scratch |
| **Map capital missing** (Natural Earth tags none) | `node scripts/build-subdivision-capitals.mjs` into a scratch copy; take only the target country's lines into `src/data/subdivisionCapitals.ts` |
| **Map polygon carries another region's code** | Confirm with `geo-code-scan.mjs` (centre and capital point to the same other polygon) and the ISO table. Move the properties in `public/subdivisions/CC.json` with a string-level edit so the geometry stays byte-identical, and check that it does. Then run `build-subdivision-meta.mjs`, `build-cities.mjs` and `build-national-capital-locations.mjs`; run the capital, capital-detail and native-name generators into scratch and take only that country's lines |
| **Wrong name, type or code** | Override tables in `scripts/build-subdivision-meta.mjs`, then `node scripts/build-subdivision-meta.mjs`; a wrong code is fixed in `public/subdivisions/CC.json` |
| **Two quiz answers, one flag** | A sourced group in `src/data/identicalSubdivisionFlags.ts` (an answer key is a division code or `capital:` plus the division's code); pairs checked and found different go in `REVIEWED_DISTINCT` in `scripts/check-identical-subdivision-flags.mjs` |

`capitalDetails.ts`, `capitalFlags.ts` and `subdivisionCapitals.ts` are generated, but they are
hand-updated to match their generator's tables until the next networked regeneration. Always
change the generator's table as well, so a regeneration cannot undo the fix.

### Step 5: explainers
Each newly shown flag gets a search for its meaning in the same change: FOTW, the local Wikipedia,
the official site. Write it only from what the source says. If nothing can be found, log the
omission with the FOTW page you checked. Run `npm run subdiv:audit-omissions` and
`npm run capitals:audit-omissions`.

### Step 6: verify, then ship
1. Run `npm run flags:check`, `npx tsc -b` and `npm run build`.
2. Run `npx vite preview --port 4173` (after the build), then
   `node scripts/flag-audit/learn-check.mjs <codes…>`. Open the screenshots. The script also
   reports whether each image actually painted, whether any flag came from a remote host, and any
   page errors.
3. For quiz changes, play `/game?mode=subnational&country=CC`.
4. Update the ledger (a new batch section), this handbook's status and queue, and the shared log.
5. Open a PR, squash-merge it, and run `node scripts/check-live-build.mjs <sha>`.

### Patterns found so far
The same bug usually occurs in several countries, so check for each of these:
- **A capital city's flag used for the province**: Italy, Spain, all of Nicaragua, Cuba.
- **Arms, seal, logo or plain text used as a flag**: Romania, South Africa, Nigeria.
- **Commons fantasy flags**: Zambia's ten provinces, five Somali and four Ghanaian regions. Commons
  tags (`{{fictitious flag}}`, `{{proposed flag}}`) or an "own work" upload with no source give
  these away.
- **A plain field that is missing its arms**: the Terni and Udine province flags.
- **A plain colour field no source documents**: Rimini, Teramo, Oristano.
- **A superseded flag**: Damascus, where the Commons file itself is named "until 2024".
- **Wikidata errors**: P36 with two values (North Sulawesi); P36 naming the wrong place
  (Schellenberg → Vaduz); a city's P41 pointing at the national flag (Porto).
- **A map polygon carrying another region's code** (so it shows that region's flag, population,
  capital and native name). Three forms: old ISO numbering (Iran before 2018 and Uganda before
  2010, fixed in 7a and 7b); codes swapped or offset between neighbours (Paktia/Paktika,
  Sala/Salacgrīva, fixed in 7b); and names and codes attached to the wrong outlines (Ecuador's
  Napo/Tungurahua, a four-way rotation in Eritrea, eight of Guyana's ten regions, fixed in 7b).
  Also Posavina carrying Republika Srpska's code (batch 1). Still open: Morocco (2015 regions).
  `scripts/flag-audit/geo-code-scan.mjs` finds these.
- **A district's or chiefdom's flag given to a city**: Kuala Terengganu, Seremban.
- **The flag of the tier above given to the capital**: Egyptian governorate flags in capital
  slots, Guatemalan department variants, Irish county GAA colours for county towns (Tipperary, Cork,
  Limerick, Longford, Waterford), Pasco Province for Cerro de Pasco. The Commons filename usually
  says so ("Governadorat de …", "… Department", "Colours of …"). **A filename is a lead, not a
  verdict:** some cities fly their department's flag (FOTW says so for Escuintla, and Antigua
  Guatemala's city flag is the Sacatepéquez design), and Gap's flag is filed on Commons as
  Beaugency's because both towns fly the same bicolour. Compare the image with the city's own FOTW
  page before rejecting.
- **A historical flag of the city**: the 1941 flags of Bistrița, Baia Mare, Zalău, Satu Mare and
  Sombor (Hungarian-era, filed on Commons with the year); Santa Isabel's colonial flag for Malabo.
- **A capital slot holding the old seat's flag after the capital moved or was re-pinned**:
  Trogen's flag for Herisau, Sievierodonetsk's for Luhansk. A manifest filename can also disagree
  with the file on disk: Donetsk's slot held Donetsk's flag while naming Kramatorsk's.
- **A logo or a photograph as a capital flag**: Abuja's logo on white (the documented flag is
  green), San Carlos's town-hall logo, a photograph of flags on a building for Luxembourg City.
- **Same design, different places**: Italian civic colours, Warsaw and Łódź, Munich and
  Baden-Württemberg. **One city in two roles**: Kyiv, the Hungarian county seats.

### Pixel metrics (`check-identical-subdivision-flags.mjs`)
- Every flag is reduced to 48×32 pixels; a pixel counts as different when a colour channel moves by
  more than the channel step.
- **Discovery** uses step 48 and flags pairs under 3%. True twins score 0.0%; the closest distinct
  pair scores 0.1% (the Estonian roofs); the first unreviewed pair scores 4.4%.
- **Group consistency** uses step 96 and fails a declared group at 10%. That step ignores shade:
  Genoa against Padua scores 5.5%, and Kecskemét's two files, one with a border, score 8.7%.
  It also mistakes green for blue (Córdoba and Tunja), so look before grouping.
- **Report modes**, which print and never gate: `--scan [--max=0.012 --channel=96]` and
  `--same-city`. The second finds one city in two roles, including pairs the pixel scan misses.

## 4. Tools

| Command | Use |
|---|---|
| `npm run flags:check` | Runs every gate. It must pass before a push |
| `node scripts/check-identical-subdivision-flags.mjs [--scan \| --same-city]` | Quiz twins: the gate and the two report modes |
| `node scripts/subdiv-remaining.mjs [CC]` / `node scripts/capital-meaning-remaining.mjs [CC]` | Explainer coverage still missing |
| `npm run subdiv:audit-omissions` / `npm run capitals:audit-omissions` | Omissions whose reasons cite too little, or cite a dead FOTW URL |
| `node scripts/build-flag-aspect-ratios.mjs` | Regenerates the flag-ratio table after a flag changes |
| `node scripts/check-live-build.mjs [sha]` (`npm run live:check`) | Confirms users can see a merge. A network failure is *inconclusive*, never a pass |
| `scripts/flag-audit/wikidata-subdivision.mjs CODE…` | The entity check: app name, capital and files beside Wikidata's item for the ISO code |
| `scripts/flag-audit/fotw-page.sh page.html` | Prints a cached FOTW page as text with its links |
| `scripts/flag-audit/wiki-raw.sh lang "Title"` | Cached raw wikitext; follows redirects |
| `scripts/flag-audit/commons-file.sh "File.svg" [dir]` | Shows a Commons file page, then downloads the file, retrying on 429 and refusing HTML |
| `scripts/flag-audit/montage.mjs list.json prefix` | Side-by-side contact sheets |
| `scripts/flag-audit/learn-check.mjs CODE…` | In-app check: panels, painted images, explainers, capital card, screenshots |
| `node scripts/check-capital-name-agreement.mjs [--all]` | The gate: every quiz capital must be the capital the Learn panel shows. `--all` also lists capital cards whose Wikidata capital differs (SF-03) |
| `scripts/flag-audit/geo-code-scan.mjs [CC…]` | Finds map polygons carrying another region's code: each region's Wikidata centre and capital should fall inside its own polygon. Swaps and cycles where both agree are the signal; one-way hits are usually enclaves or border towns |

**Network notes.** Wikimedia's `api.php` and upload.wikimedia.org answer 429 after bursts. In that
case, read wikitext and file pages through `index.php?action=raw`, download through
`Special:FilePath` with pauses (the helpers do both), and query `query.wikidata.org/sparql` for
Wikidata. When upload.wikimedia.org keeps answering 429 for hours (it did on 30 September),
`commons.wikimedia.org/w/thumb.php?f=File.svg&w=1000` still returns Commons' own PNG render from
the app servers; it is the same route the capital-flag downloader uses for oversized files. Always
send a user-agent. Some official sites refuse automated reads. A news report that
quotes the site is an acceptable citation, and the ledger should say which you used. Cloud sessions
provide Chromium at `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium`.

| 5 | #1707 `9e8449e` | Slovak, Swiss, Liechtenstein, Limburg, Comoros, Saint Helena and Russian gaps; the quiz accepts identical division flags; new identical-flag gate |
| 6a | #1708 `e3c1a35` | North Sulawesi's capital is Manado; Schellenberg's is not Vaduz; the Wikidata-capital rejection list and its check |
| 6b | #1717 `6d8406e` | The quiz accepts identical capital flags (47 sourced groups); 11 capital flags and 3 Italian province flags that no source supports removed; Minsk Region, Sofia Province and Genoa named correctly; Grenoble's explainer rewritten |
| 7a | #1720 `141cf7f` | Iran re-keyed to the current ISO codes: all 31 provinces had shown another province's population, capital and native name. Alborz gained its capital (Karaj); three capital spellings aligned so their populations show |
| 7b | #1727 `8311a07` | Map polygons carrying another region's code: Ecuador (2), Eritrea (4), Guyana (8), Afghanistan (2), Latvia (2), Uganda (33, plus Kiruhura, which was drawn as a second Mbarara). Uganda's 23 "County" labels corrected to District, and Kampala to City |
| 7c | #1728 `67773b5` | 64 quiz capitals now agree with the map: 43 spelling or renamed-city aliases, 13 overrides, 10 blocked wrong Natural Earth capitals, Laguna pinned to Santa Cruz; a capital marker can belong to several territories |
| 7d | #1730 `28316d5` | The last 12 quiz capitals fixed on the Wikidata side (Denpasar, Kendari, Palangka Raya, Herisau, Ponta Delgada, Pesaro, Cesena, Olbia, Sanluri, Nenagh, Luhansk, Donetsk; Tokyo's seat ward is not a capital); 8 wrong-entity capital flags removed (five 1941 Hungarian-era flags, Santa Isabel's colonial flag, Banjarmasin's flag on Central Kalimantan, Tipperary's GAA colours); new gate `check-capital-name-agreement.mjs` (81 → 0) |
| 7e | #1733 `342a5e0` | The 46 capital flags the 7c/7d name fixes made visible, all researched: 32 sourced explainers (Ukraine 7, Romania 3, Russia 3, Nicaragua 3, and Oslo, Gothenburg, Saint Paul, Puebla, Caracas, Maldonado, La Trinidad, Santa Cruz, Banjarbaru, among others); Khmelnytskyi's capital flag replaced (the old one is the mayor's standard since 2017); Granada (department's old flag), Huacho and Areguá (undocumented) removed; 11 omission lines given their real reason. New gate in check-city-flag-meanings: no stale "cannot be shown" omission, no code both explained and omitted |
| 7f | #1732 `1a7c5fe` | 20 capital flags that belong to someone else, or to no one, removed with evidence: Egyptian governorate flags (4), Guatemalan department variants (Jalapa, Jutiapa), Pasco Province, Irish county GAA colours (Cork, Limerick, Longford, Waterford) and an unsourced Tullamore bicolour, the Abuja and San Carlos logos, a photograph for Luxembourg City, unsourced drawings for Sokhumi and Gori, Querétaro's Commons proposal, Jinotepe without its arms, and Timișoara's 1941 flag (a Savoy file). Gap, Escuintla and Antigua Guatemala kept: their designs are the cities' own flags despite misleading filenames |
| 8a | #1734 `bdf5026` | Guatemala's 22 departments had no flag in the app: the 9 bundled files sat under ISO's 2021 numeric codes while the app uses alpha codes, and 4 of them were another entity's flag. 17 department flags now shown, each checked against FOTW (Petén from its 1998 creating agreement, Huehuetenango's 1955 flag official since 1987); 5 withheld with reasons (Baja Verapaz, Guatemala, Quiché, Sololá, Zacapa); 7 sourced explainers. Capital flags: Flores and San Marcos removed, Huehuetenango and Quetzaltenango shared with their departments; 3 capital explainers rewritten to match live sources. Mexico City's explainer re-keyed (MX-CMX → MX-DIF) and the entity renamed from "Mexico"; Venezuela's VE-A renamed Capital District. New gate: an explainer must sit under a shown code, beside a flag |
| 8b | #1735 `43d1594` | Codex's review of 30 September (evidence in `docs/audit/SUBNATIONAL_DELTA_VERIFICATION_2026-09-30.json`): F106 Khmelnytskyi's capital flag now the council's own artwork (16 rays; the SVG redraw had 12); F105 Guyana's Region 4 capital is Triumph (was Georgetown on the map and Paradise on the card) and Region 5 gains Fort Wellington, with 2012 census village populations; F104 co-capitals queued as SF-17 |
| 8c | #1736 `e095aa4` | The last 30 shown flags with no explainer: 13 British territories and Crown dependencies, Australia's and New Zealand's external territories, the Faroes, Åland, Taiwan and Tibet under China, Kosovo, Western Sahara, Northern Cyprus (twice), Paris, Érd and New Taipei. The panel looks explainers up by subdivision code, so none had rendered. Myth-versus-fact for Kosovo's stars and Northern Cyprus's stripes. `subdiv-remaining` now reads 0 and the omission audit is clean: the flag-meaning sweep is complete for every flag shown |
| 8d | #1737 `438923f` | Norway's map still showed the 19 counties abolished in 2020. It now has the 15 counties of 2024 (Kartverket's boundaries clipped to the coast, checked against Kartverket's API), re-keyed meta, capitals, SSB 1 January 2026 populations and capital flags. 12 county flags shown (7 new, 2 corrected); Innlandet, Telemark and Vestland withheld with reasons. 8 new explainers, 2 corrected |
| 8e | #1738 `081f2de` | Norway's county seats: 7 capital flags added (Stavanger, Bodø, Drammen, Hamar, Steinkjer, Tromsø, Vadsø), each checked against FOTW and Lovdata or the National Archives, with explainers. Molde, Skien, Kristiansand and Tønsberg withheld: no source documents the flag flown today |
| 8f | #1739 `9bd66b6` | Malta: 9 of the 12 councils with no flag now show their banner of arms (Birżebbuġa, Kerċem, Kirkop, Lija, Luqa, Marsa, Marsaskala, Mdina, Mellieħa), each checked against FOTW; 4 explainers. Kalkara and Paola withheld (no free file of the current flag); Marsaxlokk withheld (the only file draws the saltire violet) |
| 8g | #1740 `eacf690` | Codex F108: the British Indian Ocean Territory's flag now shows King Charles III's Tudor Crown (updated October 2025, per the BIOT administration). The Commons redraw is pinned in the downloader, the 1990–2025 flag is kept as a dated historical symbol, and the GB-IO explainer is corrected |
| 8h | #1741 `e99f6ac` | Moldova's map rebuilt on the OCHA/UNHCR boundary set: the 37 ISO units (Dubăsari district added; Camenca, Grigoriopol and duplicate features removed; Gagauzia no longer called "Comrat"). Capitals fixed (Transnistria → Tiraspol, Bender → Bender, Dubăsari → Cocieri). Flags and explainers for Transnistria (labelled not recognised by Moldova, with a disputed note), Gagauzia, Dubăsari district and Tiraspol |
| 8i | pending | Moldova's district and municipal flags: 29 added (27 districts plus Chișinău's 2020 flag and Bălți's), each a Commons original at its own size checked against FOTW; 4 explainers (Chișinău, Bălți, Florești, Strășeni), with the other districts logged as omissions after FOTW and Romanian Wikipedia were read. Briceni (no flag of its own), Glodeni (the file doesn't match the 2016 design), Hîncești and Ocnița (sparse designs available only as rasters the image gate refuses) and Bender (label decision) not shown |

The independent auditor in the shared log screened every image added through `e3c1a35`: 76
subdivision flags and 2 capital flags. Its findings F84–F86 (Estonian explainers and SVG metadata)
were fixed by the implementing agent in `f0c9407`.

The ledger's Batch 6b section gives the evidence for each change, including the Italian city and
province flags that turned out to be undocumented and Damascus's superseded flag.

**Coverage at this checkpoint:**
- About 2,100 subdivision flag files and 1,350 capital flags are bundled.
- Capital explainers are complete: every capital flag has a sourced explainer (about 1,000) or a
  logged omission.
- Subdivision explainers: `subdiv-remaining.mjs` reports 35 flags with neither an explainer nor an
  omission, all of them territories or disputed areas (see SF-08).

## 6. Open work — claim one item per PR

Claim an item before starting, as described in section 7. **Owner** is empty when an item is free.
The ledger's "Follow-ups" section has the detail behind each item.

| ID | Work | Why it matters / first step | Main files | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SF-02 | ~~Reconcile the 81 quiz capitals whose name disagrees with the Learn panel, then make the quiz apply the same agreement check~~ **Done in 7a–7d** | 81 → 77 (7a) → 76 (7b) → 12 (7c) → 0 (7d). Each was fixed at its source; the ledger's batch 7 sections list every case. `scripts/check-capital-name-agreement.mjs` now fails the build on any disagreement | `scripts/build-cities.mjs`, `scripts/build-capital-details.mjs`, `scripts/check-capital-name-agreement.mjs` | Claude Code, batch 7 (done) |
| SF-03 | Reconcile capital names (255 mismatches) | About 127 are spellings (Gent/Ghent), which need an alias table; about 128 are different cities. Fix at the source: Morocco's 2015 regions, the Greek, Afghan and Ethiopian swaps, A Coruña, Zangilan (Latvia LV-085/086, Eritrea and Paktia/Paktika were map mis-codings, fixed in 7b); check whether RO-IF's seat is Buftea | `public/subdivisions/*.json`, `scripts/build-capital-details.mjs`, `src/lib/cityRoles.ts` | |
| SF-04 | Italian capital flags, about 80 still unchecked | Check each against FOTW (via `it-muni.html`), it.wikipedia and the comune's statute; reject undocumented plain bicolours as in 6b | capital-flag files (section 3, step 4) | |
| SF-05 | Italian province flags | Look for other plain fields missing their arms (the Terni/Udine pattern) and logo flags (IT-RN, IT-SR); fill real *bandiere* still missing (Aosta Valley, South Tyrol and about 12 more) | division-flag files | |
| SF-06 | Gaps: real flags the app shows blank | About 80 North Macedonian municipalities. **Moldova, batches 8h–8i:** the map rebuilt on the 37 ISO units; 32 units now show flags. Briceni has no flag of its own; Glodeni, Hîncești, Ocnița and Bender are still to do (see the ledger's batch 8i section). **Guatemala done in batch 8a:** 17 of 22 department flags shown; Baja Verapaz, Guatemala, Quiché, Sololá and Zacapa withheld until a free file of the documented current flag exists (see the ledger's batch 8a section). **Norway done in batch 8d:** 12 of 15 county flags shown; Innlandet, Telemark and Vestland withheld (see the ledger's batch 8d section). **Malta done in batch 8f:** 9 of the 12 missing council flags shown; Kalkara, Marsaxlokk and Paola withheld (see the ledger's batch 8f section) | division-flag files, explainers | |
| SF-07 | Systematic capital-flag comparison | Compare each capital flag with the capital's own P41, country by country, looking for the district, chiefdom, province and national-flag patterns. Malaysia, Morocco and Italy's twins are done. **Batch 7f (done, #1732):** a filename scan flagged capital slots named for the province, department, governorate or county above the city; checking each file against the city's own FOTW page removed 20 (the governorate flag in 4 Egyptian slots, 2 Guatemalan department variants, Pasco Province, 4 Irish county colours and an unsourced Tullamore bicolour, Savoy's file for Timișoara, a photograph for Luxembourg, the Abuja and San Carlos logos, the Sokhumi and Gori drawings, Querétaro's proposal, Jinotepe without its arms) and kept 3 whose filenames mislead (Gap, Escuintla, Antigua Guatemala); see the ledger's batch 7f section | capital-flag files | |
| SF-08 | Territories and disputed areas without explainers (35) | GB overseas territories and Crown dependencies, French overseas departments, AU and NZ territories, CN-TW, CN-XZ, the `~` disputed codes, MX-DIF, TW-TPQ, HU-ED. First check whether the panel already shows the national-level entry. If it does, teach `subdiv-remaining.mjs` that; if not, add sourced entries | `src/data/flagMeanings.ts`, `scripts/subdiv-remaining.mjs` | |
| SF-09 | Explainers for the 35 curated-override flags | Ledger §5 lists them | `src/data/flagMeanings.ts` | |
| SF-10 | City-territory capital cards | Prague, Seoul and Busan show "No further sourced data" because the override can only fill an existing record. Refresh Korea from the 2025 census | `scripts/build-capital-details.mjs` | |
| SF-11 | Syria | Watch for a documented post-2024 Damascus flag; consider making SY-DI a city-territory so its card works like Kyiv's | `src/data/cityTerritories.ts` | |
| SF-12 | Names | PE-CUS, IT-BZ, PH-SUN. **MX-DIF done in batch 8a** ("Mexico City", Federal Entity), and VE-A ("Capital District") | `scripts/build-subdivision-meta.mjs` | |
| SF-13 | Turn `--same-city` into a gate | Keep a reviewed list of different cities that share a name (San Fernando), so a future county-seat capital flag cannot bring back an unaccepted twin | `scripts/check-identical-subdivision-flags.mjs` | |
| SF-14 | **Needs the owner** — out-of-date subdivision structures | Vietnam (2025 merger), Indonesia (6 provinces created in 2022), Latvia (2021), Nepal zones (dissolved 2015), Kenya provinces (replaced 2013), Luxembourg districts (abolished 2015), Ethiopia (SNNPR split 2023), Sardinia, Bosnia's canton codes, Uganda (the map has 112 of 135 districts: the 23 created 2010–2020 are missing), Kazakhstan (Abai, Jetisu and Ulytau, created 2022). These need new geometry, not flag edits. **Norway (2024) done in batch 8d:** no judgement call was needed, because the 2024 structure is law and Kartverket publishes the boundaries; the rest still need the owner | `public/subdivisions/*.json` | |
| SF-15 | **Needs the owner** — judgement calls | French departments (no official flags; the app mixes logos, heraldic flags and proposals); Mexican states (arms on white, used de facto); Paraguay PY-1, PY-12, PY-16; El Salvador and Honduras departments that fly their capital's flag; GE-AB note | ledger "Judgement areas" | |
| SF-16 | Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha | Their flags are bundled, but the sub-national view only opens for UN members, so no screen reaches them. The same holds for Taiwan: its municipal flags (New Taipei and others) and their explainers exist, but `country=TW` opens no panel (batch 8c) | Learn navigation | |
| SF-17 | Co-capitals (Codex F104) | A subdivision can have two or more capitals by law, but the app models one. Forlì-Cesena (Forlì and Cesena, decree-law 7 of 29 January 2024; the province's legal offices stay in Forlì), Pesaro and Urbino (both capitals, 2022 statute art. 4; provincial offices in Pesaro), the Azores (government in Ponta Delgada, assembly in Horta, judiciary in Angra do Heroísmo), Appenzell Ausserrhoden (Herisau; the courts in Trogen) and Tipperary (Nenagh and Clonmel). Batch 8d adds Norway's Agder (county hall in Kristiansand, state county governor in Arendal) and Trøndelag (administrative centre Steinkjer, county mayor in Trondheim). Batch 7d pinned one seat each so the map and the capital card agree. Showing all of them, with their roles, needs a list-valued subdivision capital, as `NationalCities.capitals` already is for countries | `cities.ts`, `capitalDetails.ts`, `cityRoles.ts`, `CapitalDetails.tsx`, the quiz capital deck | |
| SF-18 | ~~Norway's county-seat capital flags~~ **Done in batch 8e** | Ten county seats have municipal flags on their municipality items in Wikidata (P41): Stavanger, Molde, Bodø, Drammen, Hamar, Skien, Kristiansand, Steinkjer, Tromsø, Vadsø. The town items the capital pipeline reads carry none, so only Sarpsborg, Oslo and Bergen show one. Check each against FOTW and the municipality, then pin it in `CAPITAL_FLAG_SOURCE_OVERRIDES` with an explainer | `scripts/build-capital-details.mjs`, `capitalFlags.ts`, `cityFlagMeanings.ts` | |
| SF-19 | Generic "Division" type labels | 259 subdivisions in 28 countries show "Type: Division" in the Learn panel. They include all 68 of Malta's local councils (FOTW: Malta "is composed of 68 local councils"), 25 entries in Seychelles, 22 in Cape Verde and 16 in Palau. `build-subdivision-meta.mjs` falls back to "Division" (line 595) when its source gives no type. Source each country's own category from ISO 3166-2 or the country's law, set it in the generator, regenerate, and rerun `check-hierarchy-type-colors.mjs` | `scripts/build-subdivision-meta.mjs`, `src/lib/subdivisionMeta.ts` | |

## 7. Working in parallel

1. **Start from the current state.** Run `git fetch origin main`. Read this queue, the ledger's last
   batch and the shared log. Search open PRs and branches for the SF-ID you want.
2. **Claim the item.** Put your agent or branch name in its **Owner** cell, and add a row to the
   shared log with status **claimed** and the files you will touch. Commit both before the work
   (a one-line change) or as the first commit of your PR. Take one item per PR and start the PR
   title with its ID, for example `[SF-06] Norway: the 2024 county flags`. If an item is too big,
   split it into lettered parts (SF-06a Norway, SF-06b Malta) and claim only yours.
3. **Handle the files that often conflict:**
   - `scripts/data/capital-flag-sources.json` is one line of compact JSON, so any two edits
     conflict. Take main's version, then re-apply your own additions and deletions with a script:
     load the JSON, change it, and write it back with `json.dumps(…, ensure_ascii=False,
     separators=(",", ":"))`, keeping the key order.
   - `src/lib/subdivisionMeta.ts` is generated. Merge the generator's override tables, then re-run
     `node scripts/build-subdivision-meta.mjs`.
   - `src/lib/subdivisionFlagIndex.ts` (union the lists, keep them sorted), `public/flags/sources.json`
     (sorted keys, indent 2) and `src/data/flagOverlayAspectRatios.ts` (regenerate it).
   - `flagMeanings.ts` and `cityFlagMeanings.ts`: edit only your own codes' blocks, and never
     reformat the file.
   - The ledger: add your own batch section at the end, and don't reflow anyone else's.
4. **Keep two milestones apart.** Record "implemented", then "live", with the commit or PR and the
   `live:check` result, both in the shared log and in your ledger section. Only another agent can
   record "independently verified".
5. **Finish the item.** Clear it from the queue in your PR, or mark it done with the PR number, and
   update section 5.
