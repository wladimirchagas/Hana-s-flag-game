# Political-party dataset — rolling audit & refresh (2026)

**Standing mandate, given by the repository owner on 2026-09-11:**

> Audit **and fix** the Learn-mode political-party data for **all 195 countries**, one country at a
> time, in the priority order below. **Finish a country, then ship it to production before starting
> the next one.** Do not stop to ask whether to continue. The job is done only when all 195
> countries have been audited. Keep this document updated as you go so nothing is lost.

This file is the **living record**: the queue, the per-country verdicts, and every finding with its
fix. It is written incrementally — a country is added the moment its work merges, never batched.
The method, the freshness contract and the severity model live in
[`POLITICAL_PARTY_AUDIT_PROMPT.md`](./POLITICAL_PARTY_AUDIT_PROMPT.md); this file is the ledger.

**Working rule for each country:** verify → fix `src/data/politicalParties.ts` → `npm run
flags:check` → visual check in the running app → update this file → commit → PR → squash-merge →
`npm run live:check` → next country.

## Baseline as measured on 2026-09-11 (commit `c631c65`, then live)

90 of 195 countries covered · 389 parties · 11 coalitions. Whole-dataset defects found in the
survey, each to be closed as its country comes up in the queue:

| # | Defect | Scale |
|---|---|---|
| B1 | Seat sums exceed the chamber total (arithmetically impossible) | `DK` 197/179, `FI` 215/200, `NO` 191/169, `ID` 609/575, `SG` 98/97, `GY` 72/65 |
| B2 | Two different `seatsTotal` values inside one country | `ID` (575 and 580) |
| B3 | Parties recorded with 0 seats, contradicting the file's own scope rule | 19 parties; `AM` and `BD` have no seated party at all |
| B4 | Chamber coverage under 60% | 22 countries, incl. single-party entries for `DE`, `FR`, `GB`, `ES`, `CA`, `PL`, `UY` |
| B5 | No logo | 69 parties, against a 23-entry grandfather allowlist |
| B6 | `inPower` true but no `inExecutive` party | 59 of 90 countries |
| B7 | Single-source concentration | 664 of ~750 citations are English Wikipedia |
| B8 | **No date field in the schema** — staleness is undetectable by construction | whole dataset |

**B8 is the structural root cause** and is deliberately being deferred until enough countries are
refreshed to know what shape the field should take (per-party `asOf`, or per-country). It is not
forgotten; it is tracked here.

## Findings

### 🇦🇺 Australia — audited 2026-09-11

Production was showing the **2022 parliament**, three elections' worth of leadership out of date,
with a seat count that was wrong even for 2022.

Verified against the [48th Parliament of Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/48th_Parliament_of_Australia)
(party summary and the full membership-changes table) and
[Members of the Australian House of Representatives, 2025–2028](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_of_the_Australian_House_of_Representatives,_2025%E2%80%932028)
(current party standings, as of 25 June 2026 — the most recent change on record), plus each party's
own article. `aph.gov.au` returns HTTP 403 to automated fetches, so the parliamentary record was
reached through its Wikipedia mirrors rather than directly; noted as a sourcing limit, not a gap.

| ID | Sev | Field | Was | Now | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PP-001 | **S1** | `AU-LNP.leader` | Peter Dutton | — (entry replaced) | Dutton lost his own seat of Dickson at the 3 May 2025 election and ceased to be Liberal leader |
| PP-002 | **S1** | `AU-GRN.leader` | Adam Bandt | Larissa Waters | Bandt lost Melbourne in 2025; Waters is Greens leader |
| PP-003 | **S1** | `AU-LNP` identity | "Liberal/National Coalition" modelled as a single **party**, founded 1931 | Split into `AU-LIB` (Liberal, 17), `AU-NAT` (Nationals, 8) and `AU-LNP` (Liberal National Party of Queensland, 16), joined by a new `AU-COALITION` record | The Coalition is an alliance, not a party; 1931 is neither the Liberal Party's founding (1944) nor the Coalition's |
| PP-004 | **S1** | `AU-LNP.logoSourceUrl` | `File:Liberal_National_Coalition.svg` | `File:LNP_Regular.svg` | The bundled bytes (sha `1ce1c62a…`) are the **Queensland LNP** logo — verified by rendering it. Production was captioning a real party's logo as a coalition's |
| PP-005 | **S2** | `seats` / `seatsTotal` | ALP 67, LNP 58, GRN 4 of **151** | 94 / 17 / 16 / 8 / 2 / 2 / 1 / 1 / 1 of **150** | The House was reduced to 150 seats at the 2025 election. ALP 67 was wrong even for the 2022 parliament (77) |
| PP-006 | **S3** | coverage | 3 parties, 129 seats | 9 parties, 142 seats | The 8 remaining seats are independents, correctly not modelled as a party |
| PP-007 | **S3** | missing parties | — | One Nation (2), Community Strong Australia (2), Centre Alliance (1), KAP (1) added | Six bundled logos were sitting unused in `public/party-logos/au/` while the data referenced only three |
| PP-008 | **S3** | `inExecutive` | absent | `AU-ALP: true` | Second Albanese ministry, formed 13 May 2025 |
| PP-009 | **S6** | `founded`, `ideology`, `positionRaw` | ALP ideology included "Progressivism"; Greens "Social democracy"; positions loosely worded | Re-copied verbatim from each party's current infobox | e.g. Greens are "Left-wing", not "Left" |

**Judgement calls, recorded so they can be challenged.**

1. **Liberal 17 / LNP 16 / Nationals 8**, not the party-room figures the parties' own infoboxes
   give (Liberal 27, Nationals 14). The infobox numbers distribute the 16 Queensland LNP MPs into
   the two federal party rooms, so using them would double-count the LNP and push the country's
   seat sum over 150 — exactly defect B1. The disaggregated standings are cited on each entry.
2. **KAP carries `ideologyPosition: "right"` with no `positionRaw`.** English Wikipedia leaves
   KAP's position field deliberately blank by talk-page consensus, so there is no raw string to
   quote; the bucket is cited to The Conversation's survey of Australia's minor right-wing parties
   rather than assigned by us.
3. **Centre Alliance and Community Strong Australia carry no `leader`.** Neither designates one —
   Centre Alliance's sole MP calls herself "a party of one". An absent leader is the honest record.
4. **The Coalition record notes its own discontinuity**: the agreement lapsed on 22 January 2026
   and was re-formed on 8 February 2026. Shown as a coalition of three parties with the note
   attached, rather than flattened into one.

**Visual verification:** the Political parties tab renders all 9 cards grouped by ideology, every
logo painted (`img.complete && naturalWidth > 0` asserted for all nine), ALP badged *In-power*, and
the three Coalition members badged *Liberal–National Coalition*. No console errors.

### 🇲🇾 Malaysia — audited 2026-09-11

The best-kept country in the dataset so far, and the first evidence that the survey's whole-dataset
defects are not uniform: **every one of Malaysia's 22 seat figures already matched the chamber
exactly.** The failures here were relational rather than numeric.

Verified against the [Dewan Rakyat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewan_Rakyat) infobox's political
groups (dated 10 August 2026 — Government 150, Opposition 69, vacant 3, of 222), the
[Anwar Ibrahim cabinet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anwar_Ibrahim_cabinet) member-parties table
(ministers per party after the 17 December 2025 reshuffle), and all 22 parties' own infoboxes.

Reconciliation of the chamber against the dataset, party by party:
PH 76 (DAP 40, PKR 28, AMANAH 8) · BN 30 (UMNO 26, MCA 2, MIC 1, PBRS 1) · GPS 23 (PBB 14, PRS 5,
PDP 2, SUPP 2) · GRS 7 (direct 4, UPKO 2, PBS 1) · WARISAN 3 · KDM 2 · STAR 1 · PBM 1 ·
PN 49 (PAS 43, WAWASAN 6) · BERSATU 19 · MUDA 1. Every figure matched. The 10-seat gap to 222 is
7 independents and 3 vacancies — correctly not modelled as parties.

| ID | Sev | Field | Was | Now | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PP-010 | **S2** | `MY-BERSATU.coalitionId` | `MY-PN` | *(removed)* | Bersatu is no longer counted inside Perikatan Nasional: PN's own affiliate list marks it **"disputed"**, and the Dewan Rakyat counts its 19 seats as a bloc of their own, outside PN's 49. `MY-PN`'s members are now PAS + WAWASAN, with the dispute recorded in the coalition's `note` |
| PP-011 | **S3** | `inExecutive` | absent on all 22 | `true` on the 9 parties holding full cabinet portfolios — PKR (9 ministers), UMNO (7), DAP (5), PBB (3), AMANAH (2), PBRS, PDP, PRS, GRS (1 each) | The cabinet's own member-parties table. This is the first country-level fix for defect **B6** |
| PP-012 | **S6** | `MY-GRS.ideologyPosition` | `other` (no `positionRaw`) | `centre`, `positionRaw: "Centre to centre-right"` | GRS's infobox does carry a sourced position; `other` was a placeholder, not a genuine absence |
| PP-013 | — | seat citations | party articles only | every entry now also cites the Dewan Rakyat's dated composition | Closes the circular-citation risk: seats are cited to the chamber, not to the party describing itself |

**Confirmed correct, and therefore left alone:** all 22 leaders (DAP's leader is its
Secretary-General Anthony Loke, not the National Chairman — checked against the infobox's own title
fields); the 18 `inPower` flags; every `founded` year; and the `previousNames` chains, including
WAWASAN's rename from Parti Cinta Malaysia on 13 June 2026 and PBM's from Sarawak Workers Party.

**Judgement calls.**

1. **`inExecutive` means a full cabinet portfolio, not a deputy ministry.** SUPP, PBS and WARISAN
   hold deputy ministries only and are recorded `inPower: true, inExecutive: false`. MCA and MIC sit
   in the government with no portfolio at all. This reading is applied consistently from here on.
2. **GRS is modelled as a party with 4 seats** even though it is also a coalition, because the
   Dewan Rakyat itself counts 4 "GRS direct member" MPs who belong to no component party. The
   `MY-GRS` coalition record and the `MY-GRS` party entry therefore coexist by design.
3. **Bersatu is left with no coalition rather than being forced into PN.** Where a membership is
   genuinely contested, recording no coalition and explaining why beats asserting either side.

**Visual verification:** 22 cards, 21 logos asserted painted, PBM correctly rendering its "No free
image" card, In-power and coalition badges correct, GRS now grouped under Centre. No console errors.

### 🇧🇷 Brazil — audited 2026-09-11

The worst country found so far. **Ten of the twelve seat figures were wrong, ten parties were
missing — including PL, the largest party in the Chamber with 98 seats — and five parties carried
the wrong leader, one of them a deputy who belongs to a different party.**

**A better source, and why it matters.** English Wikipedia's Chamber-of-Deputies infobox lists party
figures that sum to **515 of 513** — an impossible total, so it cannot be used as the seat authority.
The Câmara dos Deputados publishes its own bench as open data
([`/api/v2/deputados`](https://dadosabertos.camara.leg.br/api/v2/deputados)); it returns all 513
sitting deputies, and the party tally sums to exactly 513. Every seat figure here now comes from
that official source. Government/opposition status comes from the
[Second cabinet of Lula da Silva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_cabinet_of_Lula_da_Silva)
(its supporting-parties table and the cabinet's own party key), and identity facts from each party's
own article.

| ID | Sev | Field | Was | Now | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PP-014 | **S3** | coverage | 12 parties, 364 / 513 | **22 parties, 513 / 513** | Missing: **PL 98**, PSB 17, PDT 9, NOVO 5, Avante 5, Solidariedade 4, REDE 3, PRD 3, DC 1, MISSÃO 1. Nine of their logos were already bundled and unreferenced; DC's was sourced and bundled in this change |
| PP-015 | **S1** | `seats` | 10 of 12 wrong | corrected | e.g. PODEMOS 11 → **27**, PSDB 33 → **18**, CIDADANIA 9 → **2**, UNIÃO 58 → **52**, PSD 43 → **48**, PP 41 → **46**, PCdoB 6 → **11** |
| PP-016 | **S1** | `leader` | PV led by **Sâmia Bomfim** — a PSOL deputy, not PV's president | José Luiz Penna | PV's own infobox |
| PP-017 | **S1** | `leader` | PSOL **Edmilson Rodrigues**; PODEMOS **Ciro Gomes**; PSDB **Bruno Araújo**; Cidadania **Roberto Freire** | Paula Coradi; Renata Abreu; Aécio Neves; Comte Bittencourt | each party's infobox |
| PP-018 | **S1** | `founded` | PSD **1945** | **2011** | 1945 is the *defunct* PSD of the Vargas era — a different party entirely |
| PP-019 | **S2** | `founded` | PP 1965; PODEMOS 2015; Republicanos 1989; Cidadania 1988 | 1995; 1995; 2003; 1992 | party infoboxes |
| PP-020 | **S1** | `ideologyPosition`, `ideology` | PODEMOS recorded as **left-wing / social democracy / environmentalism** | **centre-right**, economic liberalism, anti-corruption | Podemos is a centre-right party; the entry described a different party altogether |
| PP-021 | **S2** | `ideologyPosition` | PSD, MDB, PSDB all `centre` | all `centre-right`, each with its source's own `positionRaw` | infobox positions ("Centre to centre-right") |
| PP-022 | **S3** | `inPower` / `inExecutive` | only PT in power; `inExecutive` false everywhere | **14 in power, 11 holding ministries** | the cabinet's party key: PT 19 ministries, PSB 6, PDT/MDB/PSD/UNIÃO 3 each, PSOL 2, Republicanos/PCdoB/REDE/PP 1 each. PV, Avante and Solidariedade are coalition members without portfolios |
| PP-023 | **S1** | coalition identity | `BR-FE` named **"Frente Ampla"** (a different organisation) with a URL to match | **Federação Brasil da Esperança** / Brazil of Hope | The PT–PCdoB–PV federation registered in 2022 |
| PP-024 | **S4** | coalition URLs | `BR-UP` cited `…/wiki/Unionão_Progressista` — a malformed title that 404s; `BR-AF` cited `…/wiki/Sempre_Frente` | both re-pointed at the live articles | Link-integrity pass |
| PP-025 | **S3** | missing coalitions | 3 federations | **5** — added `BR-PSOLREDE` (PSOL + REDE) and `BR-RS` (Solidariedade + PRD) | Both are federations the Chamber counts as single blocs |
| PP-026 | **S4** | `logoSourceUrl` | recorded by hand; `BR-PSD` cited the **Brazilian Democratic Movement** article | every logo re-pointed at the Commons file whose **SHA-1 matches the bundled bytes exactly** | All 21 bundled logos were matched to Commons by content hash, not by trusting the recorded URL. This is now the standard provenance method for the sweep |

**Judgement calls.**

1. **`inPower` is the union of the cabinet's "government parties" and the parties actually holding
   ministries.** Brazil's coalition politics puts PSD, MDB, Republicanos, UNIÃO, PP and PDT in the
   cabinet while the Chamber classifies them as *Independent*; recording them as out of power would
   contradict their ministers. The Chamber's own classification is cited alongside so a reader can
   see both.
2. **REDE's `ideologyPosition` is `other`.** Its infobox gives two opposite axes ("Social:
   left-wing; Fiscal: right-wing") and no single bucket. `other` exists for exactly this.
3. **MISSÃO carries no leader.** Its infobox names none.
4. **Cidadania's exit from the PSDB federation is kept as a coalition note** — confirmed: its
   national directory voted in 2025 to end the federation in 2026, the earliest Brazilian electoral
   law allows.

**Visual verification:** 22 cards grouped by ideology, all 22 logos asserted painted after scrolling
the full grid, executive/legislative badges and all five federation labels correct. (The console
shows `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` for `restcountries.com`, which is blocked in this environment and
unrelated to party data — the bundled-fallback rule covers it.)

### 🇲🇲 Myanmar — audited 2026-09-11 · **deliberately out of scope**

Myanmar is absent from the dataset, and after auditing it the absence is **correct** — but it was
undocumented, which is the failure mode this repo calls out elsewhere ("an omission the user cannot
see makes an incomplete set look complete"). It is now recorded.

The junta held elections in three phases from 28 December 2025 to 25 January 2026, the first since
the 2021 coup. The dataset's scope rule admits only competitive multi-party systems, and this
process does not qualify on its own published record: the 2023 electoral law barred convicted
persons including Aung San Suu Kyi and Win Myint from standing, the main opposition party was
dissolved, and the vote is described by the sources as intended to legitimise continued military
rule. Beyond scope, the arithmetic is not sourceable either — declared Pyithu Hluttaw results
account for 258 elected seats across 11 parties, constituencies were cancelled for conflict, and a
quarter of the chamber is appointed by the military rather than elected, so no defensible
seats/seatsTotal pair exists.

**Decision: leave Myanmar uncovered.** Revisit if a competitively-elected chamber is seated and its
composition is published. A wrong chamber would be worse than an absent one.

### 🇹🇭 Thailand — audited 2026-09-11

Thailand was the first country found already refreshed past its most recent election — the data
reflects the **27th House elected 8 February 2026**, not the 2023 parliament. The defects were a
single wrong seat count, two missing micro-parties, a misused field, and the usual missing
`inExecutive`.

Verified against the [House of Representatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Representatives_(Thailand))
political groups (Government 292, Opposition 207, 1 vacant, of 500) and the
[Second Anutin cabinet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Anutin_cabinet).

| ID | Sev | Field | Was | Now | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PP-027 | **S2** | `TH-BJT.seats` | 192 | **191** | The chamber's own group list. Bhumjaithai leads a 292-seat government under Anutin Charnvirakul |
| PP-028 | **S1** | `TH-TST.leader` | the string *"Vacant (Sudarat Keyuraphan resigned as party leader on 12 February 2026, saying \"there is no place for idealists\" in current Thai politics)"* | *(omitted)* | The field is a person's name and is rendered as one — a 130-character sentence was being displayed to users as a leader. The resignation is now recorded in a cited source title instead. **Class defect: check every country for prose smuggled into `leader`.** |
| PP-029 | **S3** | `inExecutive` | absent on all 20 | `true` on the **12** covered parties holding ministries | The cabinet lists thirteen member parties; the thirteenth (New Dimension) is not in the dataset — see below |
| PP-030 | **S3** | coverage | 20 parties, 497 / 500 | unchanged, gap documented | Two seated parties are **knowingly absent**: **New Dimension** (1 seat, in the cabinet) and **Thai Sub Thawee** (1 seat) |

**Why two seated parties were left out — and the structural finding behind it.**
Neither has an article in English or Thai Wikipedia; the 2026 election article gives only their names
and lead candidates (Preecha Khaikaew; Melda Ketwichit). `check-political-parties.mjs` requires a
plausible `founded` year on every entry, and no source gives one for either party. Inventing a year
to satisfy the gate is exactly what the sourcing rule forbids, so they are omitted and the gap is
recorded here rather than hidden.

* **New finding — S5 (structural).** A mandatory `founded` makes a genuinely-new micro-party
  *unrepresentable*, even when its existence and seat count are beyond doubt from the chamber's own
  record. Candidate fix: allow `founded` to be omitted when a `foundedUnknownReason` documents the
  search, exactly as `noImageReason` does for logos. Deferred with **B8** until enough countries are
  done to size it; both are tracked here so neither is lost.

**Visual verification:** 20 cards, all 16 bundled logos asserted painted, the four "No free image"
cards correct, in-power badges correct.

### 🇻🇳 Vietnam — audited 2026-09-11

One party, one seat figure, and it was **right** — 482 of 500, the balance being 18 independents,
matching the National Assembly elected 15 March 2026 exactly. The failure was the person.

looks wrong. Two countries in, it has caught two mis-recorded source URLs out of 22 logos checked —
a hand-recorded URL is simply not reliable evidence of what the bundled bytes are.

Verified against the [House of Representatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Representative_Council)
and its seat template (`Template:DPR RI`), which gives all eight parties and sums to exactly 580.

**Judgement call — NasDem and PKS.** The chamber classifies them as *confidence and supply*, which
is support without joining the government, so both are recorded out of power. No per-minister source
listing cabinet portfolios by party could be reached (neither the English nor the Indonesian cabinet
article carries a machine-readable party column), so if either holds a portfolio it is not reflected
here. **That limit is recorded rather than papered over** — revisit when a minister-by-party source
is available.

**Housekeeping:** five superseded or wrong logo files were deleted (`pan.svg`, `nasdem.svg`,
`nasdem.png`, `golkar.png`, `pkb.png`).

**Visual verification:** 8 cards, all 8 logos asserted painted and montage-checked side by side —
PAN now shows the party's blue sunburst, not a restaurant.

### 🇵🇭 Philippines — audited 2026-09-11

Verified against the [House of Representatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Representatives_of_the_Philippines)
political groups for the 20th Congress (elected 12 May 2025): Majority 287, Minority 27, Independent
4, of 318 — 254 district seats plus 64 party-list seats.

| PP-044 | **S3** | `inExecutive` | absent | `true` on **PFP** only | The Philippines is presidential and Ferdinand Marcos Jr. leads PFP; no source lists cabinet portfolios by party, so the flag is confined to the President's own party |

**Documented coverage gaps — two parties that cannot be added, and 54 party-list seats.**

* **Centrist Democratic Party (1 seat)** and **Partido Navoteño (1 seat)** sit in the majority bloc
  and are *not* in the dataset, because neither has a logo file anywhere: CDP's infobox `logo` field
  contains the literal string `200px` (a broken parameter) and Navoteño's article has no logo at
  all. The political-party rule requires every new entry to carry a bundled logo, and
  `noImageReason` is reserved for entries predating 2026-09-08, so **the gate makes these parties
  unrepresentable.** This is the same structural wall Thailand hit on `founded` — see **S5** below.
* **54 of the 64 party-list seats** belong to sectoral organisations the dataset does not model
  (ACT-CIS, CIBAC, SAGIP, Kabataan, TUCP, Senior Citizens, 1-Rider and roughly forty more, most with
  a single seat). Four are modelled and correct. This is a recorded, deliberate gap for a later
  pass, not an oversight — it is why Philippine coverage reads 261/318 rather than ~315/318.

* **S5 (structural), second instance.** Two different mandatory fields have now blocked real, seated
  parties from being recorded: `founded` in Thailand and `logo` here. The gate is protecting quality
  in general while producing *invisible* incompleteness in particular. Candidate fix, to be proposed
  once more countries are done: extend the `noImageReason` pattern to any mandatory field —
  a sourced, human-written reason for the gap, visible in the UI, beats an absent party.

**Visual verification:** 16 cards, 15 logos asserted painted (the sixteenth is a documented
no-image entry), the three new logos montage-checked before bundling.

Both seat figures, both leaders (Lawrence Wong; Pritam Singh) and both logos' provenance were

### 🇰🇭 Cambodia — audited 2026-09-11

Seats were right (CPP 120, FUNCINPEC 5, of 125). Everything else about the CPP entry was not.

| ID | Sev | Field | Was | Now | Evidence |

Second wrong-logo find of the sweep after Indonesia's restaurant chain |
| PP-048 | **S1** | `KH-CPP.leader` | **Hun Manet**, titled "Prime Minister" | **Hun Sen**, President | Hun Manet is Prime Minister and a party vice-president; the CPP's president is Hun Sen. The field is the *party* leader |

| PP-050 | **S3** | `inExecutive` | absent | `true` on CPP | Cabinet of Hun Manet |

**Method note — two wrong logos in ten countries.** Both were found by the SHA-1 provenance check
followed by actually *looking* at the image, and neither was detectable from the recorded metadata.
A Commons match is necessary but not sufficient: `Cpp 2.png` is a real Commons file, freely
licensed, and still the wrong picture. **Rendering every logo is now part of the per-country loop.**

Leader (Thongloun Sisoulith) and founding year (22 March 1955) were checked and are correct; the
logo was rendered and is the party's red hammer-and-sickle.

**Pattern worth naming: the `.svg`-extension-on-PNG-bytes defect has now appeared in Cambodia (2
files) and Laos (1).** It is invisible in the browser because content sniffing rescues it, and
invisible to the gate because the check only verifies the sha256. Worth a mechanical sweep across
all bundled party logos in a later structural PR — added to the deferred list with **B8** and the
mandatory-field wall.

### 🇧🇳 Brunei — audited 2026-09-11 · **country removed**

The only country so far whose entry had to be **deleted rather than corrected**, because what it
asserted was not true of Brunei at all.

The dataset carried three parties — PDNB credited with **1 seat**, PNDB and PNS with 0 — in a
36-seat chamber. Brunei's [Legislative Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislative_Council_of_Brunei)
has **34 members, every one of them ex-officio (14) or appointed and non-partisan (20)**. No party
holds a seat, and none can: Brunei is an absolute monarchy and, as the National Development Party's
own article states, **no legislative election has been held in Brunei since 1962.**

| ID | Sev | Finding |
|---|---|---|
| PP-054 | **S1** | A party was credited with a seat in a legislature that has **no elected members and no party representation whatsoever**. This is not a stale figure — it describes a parliamentary system Brunei does not have |
| PP-055 | **S1** | `seatsTotal` 36 against an actual membership of 34 |
| PP-056 | **S2** | Two of the three entries held 0 seats, already contradicting the file's own scope rule ("only parties currently holding at least one seat") |

**Decision: remove Brunei from `POLITICAL_PARTIES` and delete its three bundled logos.** The file's
scope rule admits only competitive multi-party systems; Brunei is an absolute monarchy with an
appointed legislature. Keeping the entry would assert representation that does not exist, which is
worse than the country being absent — the same reasoning that keeps **Myanmar** out.

**Verified in the running app:** Brunei's page renders normally and the Political parties tab is
simply **not offered** (tabs: National symbols, Sub-national divisions, Capital cities, Hierarchy),
with no console errors. A country with no party data degrades cleanly by design.

**This closes 3 of the 19 zero-seat entries in defect B3.** The remaining 16 are checked as their
countries come up.

### 🇹🇱 Timor-Leste — audited 2026-09-11 · **Southeast Asia complete**

Every seat figure was already correct (CNRT 31, FRETILIN 19, PD 6, KHUNTO 5, PLP 4 = 65), as were

It was live, rendering as a broken image |
| PP-058 | **S1** | `TL-CNRT.logo` | **"CNRT — CONTROL DEL TRANSPORTE"**, a Spanish transport-control company | the National Congress for Timorese Reconstruction's own emblem | Acronym collision, rendered and confirmed |

| PP-060 | **S2** | `TL-FRETILIN.leader` | Francisco Guterres (Lú-Olo), as President | **Mari Alkatiri, Secretary-General** | FRETILIN's infobox now records its presidency as `TBD`; the Secretary-General is the sourced office-holder, so the entry names the office that actually exists |
| PP-061 | **S2** | file types | `cnrt.svg` was PNG bytes; `plp.svg` replaced by the party's own file | all extensions now match their bytes | Same `.svg`-on-not-SVG defect as Cambodia and Laos |

**Five wrong logos in thirteen countries — and every one was an acronym or name collision.**
pans & COMPANY for PAN, an unidentified magenta mark for the CPP, a transport firm for CNRT, a
games console for PD, and an audio clip for FRETILIN. This is the **Misiones bug** the repo's flag
rules were written for, reproduced wholesale in the party data. It is also why the loop now ends
with rendering every logo: four of the five passed a Commons or Wikipedia lookup, and three of them
were freely licensed. **Provenance proves where bytes came from; only looking proves what they are.**

### 🇦🇷 Argentina — audited 2026-09-11

The strongest country yet on numbers: **all nineteen blocs reconciled exactly** against the Chamber
of Deputies after the 26 October 2025 legislative election — LLA 95, FP 93, United Provinces 18,
PRO 12, Innovación Federal 7, UCR 6, FIT-U 4, three 3-seat blocs, four 2-seat blocs and five
1-seat blocs, summing to 257 of 257. All seven bundled logos matched Commons or Wikipedia by SHA-1
and rendered correctly.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PP-062 | **S2** | `AR-UXP.name` | **Unión por la Patria** | **Fuerza Patria** / Homeland Force, with the old name preserved in `previousNames` (2023–2025) | The coalition was renamed in 2025. Argentina's main opposition bloc — 93 seats — was carrying a superseded name |
| PP-063 | **S3** | `inExecutive` | absent | `true` on LLA only | Javier Milei's party; the chamber separates Government (95) from Allies (24), so PRO, UCR, MID and the small provincial blocs stay out of power |

**Unresolved, flagged rather than guessed.** The chamber now lists a 3-seat bloc as **"País
Federal"** where the dataset has **"Coherencia"** (also 3 seats, led by Marcela Pagano, formed
August 2025 by four ex-libertarians). They may be the same bloc renamed, or two different ones.
Neither English nor Spanish Wikipedia search resolved it within this pass, so **the entry is left
unchanged and the discrepancy recorded here** — changing a name on a guess is what the sourcing
rule forbids. Recheck when a source lists the bloc's membership.

**Note on modelling:** Argentina's entries are legislative *blocs*, not registered parties. That was
an existing choice and it matches how the chamber itself reports composition; it is noted so a later
reviewer knows it is deliberate.

### 🇨🇱 Chile — audited 2026-09-11

The entry described **a parliament and a government that no longer exist.** It held seven parties
and 132 of 155 seats with Gabriel Boric's Frente Amplio governing; the **16 November 2025 general
election** produced a new chamber and a new, right-wing government.

Verified against the [Chamber of Deputies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_of_Deputies_of_Chile):
Government 67 (Republicans 31, UDI 18, the RN group 16, 2 independents), supported by 8 (PNL),

| PP-069 | **S2** | junk files | three stray `*.svg.sha256` text files in `public/` | deleted | Not images; they were being shipped to users' browsers as part of the static site |

**Documented gap.** **FREVS** (Social Green Regionalist Federation, 2 seats) is **not added**: it has
no logo on English *or* Spanish Wikipedia, and the gate requires one on every new entry. This is the
**third** time a mandatory field has blocked a real seated party — `founded` in Thailand, `logo` in
the Philippines, `logo` here — and the reason Chile reads 151/155 rather than 153/155 (the other
2 seats are independents).

**Seven wrong logos in fifteen countries, every one a name collision.** Chile contributed two of the
starkest: a party's opponents' logo, and a French party's logo. Both were caught the same way —
SHA-1 provenance, then rendering the image and looking at it.

### 🇨🇴 Colombia — audited 2026-09-12

The dataset held **five parties covering 102 of a stated 188 seats**, with leaders attached to the
wrong parties. Colombia elected a new Chamber on **8 March 2026** and a new President took office in
August, so nothing in the entry survived.

**English Wikipedia could not be used, and that is itself a finding.** Its Chamber-of-Representatives
infobox lists blocs totalling 85 + 69 + 44 = 198, whose member parties sum to **202**, against a
stated **183 members** — internally inconsistent three ways over. The **Spanish** article
([`Cámara de Representantes de Colombia`](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A1mara_de_Representantes_de_Colombia))
reconciles exactly: Government 118 + Independents 11 + Opposition 44 + special seats 9 + 1 = **183**.
Every seat figure here comes from it. That is the second country (after Brazil) where the English
chamber article was arithmetically impossible and a better source had to be found — **checking that
the composition sums to the chamber size is now a standing step in the loop.**

**`inExecutive` is `false` for every Colombian party, and that is a sourced statement, not a gap.**
President **Abelardo de la Espriella** (in office since 2026) leads **Defensores de la Patria**,
founded 2024 — a party that holds **no seats in the Chamber at all**. So no seated party is the
President's. Whether any coalition party holds ministries could not be sourced (no cabinet article
with a party column was reachable), and that limit is recorded here rather than guessed at.

**Documented gaps — 25 of the 183 seats are deliberately not modelled.**

* **18 are not party seats**: the 16 **CITREP** transitional peace-constituency seats (11 counted
  with the government, 5 special), the **Consejo Comunitario El Naranjo** (a community council), and
  one **Raizal** representative. Modelling these as parties would misdescribe them.
* **7 belong to four parties that could not be completed**: **Partido Demócrata Colombiano** (3) —
  no founding year in any reachable source; **Colombia Renaciente** (2), **La Fuerza** (1) and
  **Movimiento Unidad en Minga por Colombia** (1) — no logo file on Commons or either Wikipedia.
  Same mandatory-field wall as Thailand and the Philippines; recorded, not hidden.

All 13 bundled logos were SHA-1 matched to Commons or English Wikipedia and montage-verified.

### 🇵🇪 Peru — audited 2026-09-12

Peru's parties were the right six, but the entry described **a legislature that no longer exists**.

At the 12–13 April 2026 general election Peru returned to a **bicameral** Congress after thirty
years: a 60-member Senate and a **130-member Chamber of Deputies**. The dataset still named the old
unicameral "Congress of the Republic" and carried a seat split that matches neither house.

| ID | Sev | Field | Was | Now | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PP-070 | **S1** | `chamberName` | "Congress of the Republic" | **"Chamber of Deputies"** | The Congress has been bicameral since the 2026 election; the Congress article's own header reads "Unicameral (1995–2026)" |
| PP-071 | **S1** | `seats` | FP 24, JP 9, RP 15, PBG 22, OBRAS 16, AN 14 — summing to 100 of 130 | **FP 41, JP 32, PBG 18, RP 15, OBRAS 14, AN 10 — exactly 130 of 130** | The Chamber's own composition |

| PP-074 | **S3** | `inPower` / `inExecutive` | false on every party | `true` on **Popular Force** | **Keiko Fujimori**, Popular Force's leader, is President of Peru. Popular Renewal is recorded as *supported by* the government, so it stays out of power — the same reading applied in Indonesia |

All six logos were SHA-1 matched to Commons and montage-verified. Seats now reconcile exactly, which
closes Peru's contribution to defect **B4** (chamber coverage below 60% — it was 77%).

### 🇻🇪 Venezuela — audited 2026-09-12

Venezuela was the **single most wrong country** the sweep has reached. The dataset held **one party**
— PSUV — credited with **277 of 277** seats: a chamber size that was retired at the 2025 election, a
seat count that asserted a one-party legislature, and a logo that had been written off as
unsourceable when the party's own 2024 mark sits on Commons in the public domain.

The National Assembly's **VI Legislature** was installed on 5 January 2026 with **285** seats. Nine
parties of the governing **Gran Polo Patriótico Simón Bolívar** hold 253 of them (PSUV itself holds
**219**, not all of them); three are indigenous seats; and **eleven** further parties sit in three
opposition parliamentary groups.

Nicolás Maduro remains the formally elected party president but has been in United States custody since January 2026; the party's own infobox now names Rodríguez as its leader |
| PP-078 | **S1** | `inExecutive` context | "Diosdado Cabello … in executive power" | PSUV holds the presidency through **Delcy Rodríguez, interim president since 2026** | Maduro was captured during the United States intervention in Venezuela; Rodríguez, his vice-president since 2018, is the first woman to perform the duties of the presidency |
| PP-079 | **S1** | `founded` | **1997** | **2007** | 1997 is the founding year of the *Fifth Republic Movement*, one of PSUV's merger predecessors. PSUV itself dates from 2007 (es.wikipedia gives 14 March 2008 for its registration — the discrepancy is recorded here, not resolved by guessing) |
| PP-080 | **S2** | `noImageReason` | "no freely-licensed vectorized logo available" | **`party-logos/ve/psuv.svg`** | `PSUV 2024 logo.svg` is on Commons in the **public domain**. The reason was wrong, and PSUV has now been removed from `GRANDFATHERED_PARTIES_WITH_NO_IMAGE` |
| PP-081 | **S3** | `chamberName` | "National Assembly (disputed)" | **"National Assembly"** | `chamberName` names the chamber; the recognition dispute belongs in the sources, where it now is (the English article's "partial recognition" note is cited) |
| PP-082 | **S3** | coalitions | none | **`VE-GPPSB`** (9 seated members) and **`VE-AD-ALLIANCE`** (7) | The governing Chavista alliance and the opposition Democratic Alliance |

**A judgement call, recorded.** Acción Democrática, Primero Justicia and Copei hold their seats
through the **ad hoc boards imposed by the Supreme Tribunal of Justice**, not through the leaderships
those parties themselves recognise. The dataset shows each party's own leadership (AD: Isabel Carmona
de Serra, the *dirección en resistencia*) and states the ad-hoc split in that party's sources and in
the `VE-AD-ALLIANCE` coalition note. Suppressing either fact would take a side.

**Documented gaps — 8 of the 285 seats are deliberately not modelled.**

* **3 are indigenous seats**, elected nationally by indigenous communities and not held by a party.
* **5 belong to Vamos Vamos Cojedes**, a regional party registered on 11 April 2025. No logo file
  exists on Commons, on either Wikipedia, or anywhere freely licensable (the party's presence is
  social-media only), and the gate forbids a new no-image entry. Recorded, not hidden — the same
  mandatory-field wall as Thailand, the Philippines and Colombia.

All 20 bundled logos were resolved on Commons, downloaded, checked that their bytes match their
extension, and **montage-verified**. That pass mattered: UNICA's Commons file is named
`GqRp6FJXgAA6TRL.jpg` — a raw social-media filename of exactly the shape that produced seven wrong
logos earlier in this sweep — and rendering it confirmed it really is the Unión y Cambio mark.

### 🇪🇨 Ecuador — audited 2026-09-12

Ecuador's entry described the **2021–2023 Assembly**: 137 seats, when the chamber has had **151**
since the 2023 snap election. Every seat figure, every founding year, and one entire party were
wrong.

The fifth legislative period was elected on 9 February 2025: **Government 78** (ADN 66, PSP 1, two
provincial movements, 9 independents), **Opposition 61** (RC 59, RETO 1, one provincial), **unaligned
12** (Pachakutik 3, PSC 3, 6 independents) — 151 exactly.

| ID | Sev | Field | Was | Now | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PP-083 | **S1** | `seatsTotal` | **137** | **151** | 137 was the 2021–2023 Assembly. The chamber has 151 members |
| PP-084 | **S1** | existence | **`EC-UDCPP` "Unión Demócrata Cristiana", 17 seats** | **removed** | The article redirects to **Democracia Popular**, founded 1977 — a party that holds **no seats at all** in this Assembly. The entry also gave it the wrong founding year (1978) and the Social Christian Party's English name |
| PP-085 | **S1** | `seats` | ADN 35, RC 27, PK 15 | **ADN 66, RC 59, PK 3** | Pachakutik was over-credited five-fold; ADN and RC both roughly doubled |

| PP-089 | **S2** | `logo` | RC carried an older mark | **`Logo-rc5-actual-a-color.png`** (the current RC5 logo) | Commons |
| PP-090 | **S3** | `ideology` | ADN "Conservatism, Social democracy"; RC "Left-wing, Socialism, Progressivism" | re-copied verbatim from each infobox | "Left-wing" is a *position*, not an ideology; ADN's own article gives right-wing populism, personalism, neoliberalism |
| PP-091 | **S3** | `inPower` | ADN only | ADN **and PSP** | The Assembly's own *Oficialismo* grouping counts PSP with the government |

**Documented gap — 18 of the 151 seats are deliberately not modelled**: **15 independents** and
**3 provincial-movement** seats, none of which is a national party.

All six logos were downloaded from Commons, byte-checked against their extension, and
montage-verified (each carries its CNE ballot list number — ADN 7, Pachakutik 18, PSC 6, PSP 3,
RC 5, RETO 33 — which is a useful confirmation that each is the electoral mark, not a corporate one).
All four of Ecuador's entries have left `GRANDFATHERED_PARTIES_WITH_NO_IMAGE`.

### 🇧🇴 Bolivia — audited 2026-09-12

Bolivia's three entries were **garbled rather than merely stale**: two of them named a party that
does not exist under that name, and attached to it the leader of a *different* party.

The Chamber of Deputies elected on 17 August 2025 seats seven groups across 130 members: **PDC 49**
(government), **Alianza Libre 39**, **Unidad 26**, **Alianza Popular 8**, **APB Súmate 5** (ally),
**MAS-IPSP 2**, **Bia Yuqui 1**. Rodrigo Paz of the PDC has been president since 8 November 2025.

| ID | Sev | Field | Was | Now | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PP-092 | **S1** | existence | **"Arcistas por Bolivia" (16 seats), led by Luis Fernando Camacho**; **"Unidad Movil" (8), led by Oscar Ortiz** | removed; replaced by the groups that actually sit | Neither name appears in the Chamber. Camacho leads **Creemos**, not an "Arcistas" party; "Unidad Movil" is not a Bolivian party at all — the bloc is **Bloque de Unidad** |
| PP-093 | **S1** | coverage | 3 parties, 26 of 130 | **6 parties, 129 of 130** | Five of the seven seated groups were absent, including **PDC**, the party of the President, with 49 seats |
| PP-094 | **S1** | `inPower` / `inExecutive` | **false on every party** — Bolivia had no governing party at all | **PDC** in power and in the executive; **APB Súmate** in power as its ally | Rodrigo Paz (PDC) took office 8 November 2025 |
| PP-095 | **S1** | `chamberName` | "Plurinational Legislative Assembly" | **"Chamber of Deputies"** | The Assembly is the whole bicameral body (130 + 36); 130 is the lower house alone |
| PP-096 | **S2** | `seats` | MAS 2 | 2 — **the one figure that was right** | MAS-IPSP collapsed from governing party to two seats at the 2025 election |
| PP-097 | **S3** | `founded` | "Arcistas" 2017, "Unidad Movil" 2018 | n/a — entries removed | Both were inventions of the removed entries |

**Documented gap — 1 of the 130 seats is deliberately not modelled.** **Bia Yuqui** (Consejo Indígena
Yuqui Bia Recuate) holds one special indigenous-constituency seat, and no reachable source gives it a
founding year, which the schema requires. Recorded, not hidden — the same mandatory-field wall as
Thailand, the Philippines, Chile, Colombia and Venezuela.

All six logos were downloaded from Commons (all public domain), byte-checked against their extension,
and montage-verified.

### 🇵🇾 Paraguay — audited 2026-09-12

Paraguay's entry had the **wrong chamber size**, and every seat figure was scaled to it. The Chamber
of Deputies has **80** members, not 128 — 128 is not the size of either Paraguayan house (the Senate
has 45), so the figure appears to have been invented rather than taken from a superseded chamber.

The Chamber elected on 30 April 2023 sits **ANR 48** (government), **PLRA 22**, **Yo Creo 3**, 3
independents, and one seat each for **PCN**, **PEN**, **PPQ** and **PPS**.

| ID | Sev | Field | Was | Now | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PP-098 | **S1** | `seatsTotal` | **128** | **80** | The Chamber has 80 deputies; the Senate has 45. 128 matches neither, nor their sum |
| PP-099 | **S1** | `seats` | ANR 51, PLRA 38 | **ANR 48, PLRA 22** | The Chamber's own composition, corroborated by both parties' English infoboxes |
| PP-100 | **S1** | existence | **"Hagamos" (26 seats), founded 2018** | **removed** | No party of that name sits in the Chamber. The 26 seats were spread across five parties that were absent |
| PP-101 | **S1** | `founded` | PLRA **1873** | **1887** | The PLRA dates from 10 July 1887; the ANR from 11 September 1887, eight weeks later — the dataset had the ANR's year right and the PLRA's wrong by fourteen years |
| PP-102 | **S2** | coverage | 3 parties (one fictitious), 115 of a wrong 128 | **7 parties, 77 of 80** | Added Yo Creo (3), PCN, PEN, PPQ and PPS (1 each) |
| PP-103 | **S2** | `noImageReason` | all three entries claimed no freely-licensed logo exists | **all seven now carry one** | Every one is on Commons; the ANR's and PLRA's are SVGs in the public domain |
| PP-104 | **S3** | `leader` | PLRA and "Hagamos" had none | **Alcides Riveros**, plus a leader for each new party | party infoboxes |

**Documented gap — 3 of the 80 seats are independents**, not a party.

All seven logos were downloaded from Commons, byte-checked against their extension, and
montage-verified. Paraguay's three entries have left `GRANDFATHERED_PARTIES_WITH_NO_IMAGE`.

---

### 🇺🇾 Uruguay — audited 2026-09-12

Uruguay had **one party**, and the most interesting defect in the sweep so far: a **fabricated
logo explainer**.

`UY-FA` carried a `logoMeaning` asserting that the Frente Amplio's emblem "features a red and white
color scheme", that "the red represents the socialist and social democratic values of the alliance,
while white symbolizes peace and democratic governance" — cited to the party's English Wikipedia
article, which says nothing of the kind. **The image is not red and white.** It is the Frente Amplio
flag: red, blue and white bands with a yellow FA monogram. So the text was not merely unsourced
(which the flag-meaning hard rule already forbids) — it described a picture that is not there, with
a citation that does not support it. Removed rather than rewritten: no source documents the emblem's
symbolism.

The Chamber of Representatives elected on 27 October 2024 seats **FA 48** (government) against an
opposition of 51: the **Coalición Republicana** 47 (Partido Nacional 29, Partido Colorado 17,
Partido Independiente 1), **Identidad Soberana** 2 and **Cabildo Abierto** 2.

| ID | Sev | Field | Was | Now | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PP-105 | **S1** | `logoMeaning` | fabricated symbolism, wrong about the image itself, cited to an article that does not contain it | **removed** | The flag-meaning hard rule: never fabricate, always cite. The emblem is red/blue/white with a yellow FA monogram |
| PP-106 | **S1** | `seatsTotal` | **130** | **99** | 130 is not a Uruguayan number at all — the Chamber has 99 representatives and the Senate 30 |
| PP-107 | **S1** | `chamberName` | "Chamber of Deputies" | **"Chamber of Representatives"** | Uruguay's lower house is the Cámara de Representantes |
| PP-108 | **S1** | `leader` | **Yamandú Orsi** | **Fernando Pereira** | Orsi is *President of Uruguay*; the Frente Amplio's own president is Pereira. The party's head of state was being shown as its party leader |
| PP-109 | **S1** | coverage | 1 party, 48 of a wrong 130 | **6 parties, 99 of 99 — exact** | Five of the six seated parties were absent, including the 29-seat Partido Nacional |
| PP-110 | **S2** | `timeInPower` | "2025-present" | a sentence naming the date and the event | The field is prose elsewhere in the dataset; a bare year range reads as a data artefact |
| PP-111 | **S3** | logo path | `party-logos/**UY**/…` | `party-logos/**uy**/…` | The only upper-case logo directory in the repository |
| PP-112 | **S3** | coalitions | none | **`UY-CR`** (Coalición Republicana, 3 members, 47 seats) | The Chamber's own grouping |

**Two non-free logos, declared.** Identidad Soberana's and Cabildo Abierto's emblems have no
freely-licensed file on Commons; both are bundled from the SVGs English Wikipedia hosts under a
fair-use rationale, each carrying a `licenceNote` stating the copyright position — the same
owner-directed position taken for the non-free football crests and passport covers. Note that
Spanish Wikipedia's Identidad Soberana infobox uses **a cropped photograph of the party's candidate**
in the logo slot; using it would have put a man's face on the card as a party emblem, which is
exactly the class of wrong-image bug the montage pass exists to catch.

All six logos were byte-checked against their extension and montage-verified. Uruguay's seats now
reconcile **exactly** — 99 of 99.

### 🇬🇾 Guyana — audited 2026-09-12

Guyana's three parties summed to **72 seats in a 65-seat chamber** — an arithmetically impossible
total sitting in production, and the third country in this sweep whose numbers could have been
falsified without leaving the dataset (after Singapore's 98-of-108 and Brazil's 515-of-513).

The 13th Parliament was elected on 1 September 2025: **PPP/C 36** (government), **WIN 16**,
**PNCR–APNU 12**, **Forward Guyana Movement 1**.

| ID | Sev | Field | Was | Now | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PP-113 | **S1** | `seats` | PPP/C 43 + APNU 25 + AFC 4 = **72 of 65** | **PPP/C 36, WIN 16, PNCR 12 = 64 of 65** | The Assembly's own composition. The old figures were the 2020 Parliament's, and even then did not sum |
| PP-114 | **S1** | existence | **AFC** (Alliance For Change), 4 seats | **removed** | The AFC contested 2025 separately from APNU and won **no seats** |
| PP-115 | **S1** | existence | **APNU** as a party, 25 seats | replaced by **PNCR** (12) | APNU is a coalition, not a party; the 12 seats are the PNCR's, which the Assembly lists as "PNCR–APNU" |
| PP-116 | **S1** | coverage | **WIN** absent | **16 seats — the official opposition** | WIN was founded on 23 June 2025 and became the second-largest party in the chamber ten weeks later. Its leader, Azruddin Mohamed, is Leader of the Opposition |
| PP-117 | **S2** | `noImageReason` | all three claimed no freely-licensed logo exists | **all three now carry one** | Two are non-free (declared); the PNCR's is a CC BY-SA file on Commons |
| PP-118 | **S3** | `previousNames` | none | PPP (1950–1991); PNC (1957–1997) and PNC/R (1997–2001) | each party's own abbreviation history |

**Two non-free logos, declared.** The PPP/C's and WIN's emblems exist only as fair-use files on
English Wikipedia; both carry a `licenceNote` stating the copyright position, as for the non-free
football crests and passport covers.

**One judgement call, recorded.** The PNCR has no logo at all — its own Wikipedia infobox carries a
`flag` and an empty `logo` field — so the bundled image is the **party's flag** (red/black/green with
a palm tree in a white disc), which is the emblem the party itself uses. That is the party's own
symbol, not a national or coalition flag, so it is not the parent-flag-collision case; it is recorded
here so a later reviewer can see it was a decision rather than an accident.

**Documented gap — 1 of the 65 seats.** The **Forward Guyana Movement** has no article on any
Wikipedia, no logo file, and no sourceable founding year. Recorded, not hidden.

All three logos were byte-checked against their extension and montage-verified. Guyana's three
entries have left `GRANDFATHERED_PARTIES_WITH_NO_IMAGE`.

### 🇸🇷 Suriname — audited 2026-09-12

Suriname had **two entries, both wrong about who governs**. `SR-NF` — "Nieuw Front voor Democratie",
marked as **in power** with 20 seats — is a coalition that contested the elections of 1987 to 2005
and has not existed as a parliamentary force for two decades. Meanwhile the VHP, which really did
govern from 2020 to 2025, was marked **out** of power with the wrong seat count.

The 8th National Assembly was elected on 25 May 2025: **NDP 18**, **VHP 17**, **ABOP 6**, **NPS 6**,
**PL 2**, **BEP 1**, **A20 1**. Jennifer Geerlings-Simons (NDP) was inaugurated president on
16 July 2025, so the VHP moved to opposition.

| ID | Sev | Field | Was | Now | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PP-119 | **S1** | existence | **`SR-NF` "Nieuw Front voor Democratie", 20 seats, in power** | **removed** | A 1987 electoral coalition, not a party, and not a force in the Assembly since 2005 |
| PP-120 | **S1** | `inPower` | NF in power; VHP out | **NDP, ABOP, NPS, PL and BEP in power; VHP in opposition** | The Assembly's own Government/Opposition grouping |

| PP-122 | **S2** | `seats` | VHP 14 | **17** | The VHP is the whole of the opposition |
| PP-123 | **S2** | `founded` | VHP **1961** | **1949** | The VHP dates from January 1949 |
| PP-124 | **S2** | `noImageReason` | both entries claimed no freely-licensed logo exists | **all six now carry one** | Two are on Commons in the public domain; three are non-free (declared) |
| PP-125 | **S3** | `leader` | neither entry had one | **four of the six do** | party infoboxes. The VHP's own infobox gives its chairman as "TBD", so it correctly has none |

**Three non-free logos, declared.** The VHP's, NPS's and BEP's emblems exist only as fair-use files on
English Wikipedia; each carries a `licenceNote` stating the copyright position.

**Documented gap — 1 of the 51 seats.** **Alternatief 2020** has no logo file on Commons or either
Wikipedia; its article's infobox `logo` field is empty. Recorded, not hidden.

All six logos were byte-checked against their extension and montage-verified. Suriname's two entries
have left `GRANDFATHERED_PARTIES_WITH_NO_IMAGE` — **which empties that list of every South American
entry.**

## Phase 3 complete — South America, all 11 countries

Every South American country has now been audited, fixed, merged and confirmed live. What the
continent looked like before this sweep:

* **Two countries carried arithmetically impossible seat totals** (Guyana 72 of 65; and Colombia's
  English-Wikipedia source was inconsistent three ways over).
* **Five countries contained entries for parties that do not exist** — Ecuador's "Unión Demócrata
  Cristiana" with 17 seats, Bolivia's "Arcistas por Bolivia" and "Unidad Movil", Paraguay's
  "Hagamos", Suriname's "Nieuw Front", Guyana's "APNU" as a party.
* **Three countries showed the wrong government or none at all** — Bolivia had no governing party
  while the PDC held the presidency; Suriname marked a defunct 1987 coalition as in power; Venezuela
  credited one party with every seat in the legislature.
* **Two countries had a chamber size that matches no real chamber** — Paraguay's 128, Uruguay's 130.
* **One carried a fabricated logo explainer** — Uruguay's, which described colours the image does
  not have.
* **Seven wrong logos were found and replaced across the continent**, every one a name or acronym
  collision, including the French UDI's logo on Chile's UDI and the Republican Party's on the
  Radicals.

Coverage went from 61 parties to 128; six of the eleven countries now reconcile exactly against
their chamber.

## Phase 4 — United Kingdom, United States, Canada

### 🇬🇧 United Kingdom — audited 2026-09-12

The UK had **one party**: Labour, with 412 seats, led by **Keir Starmer**, who has not been prime
minister since **20 July 2026**. Fourteen other parties sit in the Commons and none of them was in
the dataset — including the Official Opposition.

The 59th Parliament's current standing: **Labour 403** (government), **Conservative 118** (Official
Opposition), **Liberal Democrats 71**, **Reform UK 8**, **SNP 8**, **DUP 5**, **Green 5**,
**Independent Alliance 4**, **Plaid Cymru 4**, **SDLP 2**, **Your Party 2**, **Alliance 1**,
**Restore Britain 1**, **TUV 1**, **UUP 1**, 7 independents, the Speaker, **Sinn Féin 7**
(abstentionist) and 1 vacancy.

| ID | Sev | Field | Was | Now | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PP-126 | **S1** | `leader` | **Keir Starmer** | **Andy Burnham** | Burnham has led Labour and been prime minister since 20 July 2026 |
| PP-127 | **S1** | coverage | **1 party** | **15 parties, 637 of 650** | The Conservative Party — the Official Opposition, with 118 seats — was not in the dataset at all, nor were the Liberal Democrats' 71 |
| PP-128 | **S2** | `seats` | Labour **412** | **403** | 412 was the 2024 election night figure; by-elections, defections and suspensions have moved it |
| PP-129 | **S3** | `timeInPower` | absent detail | a sentence naming both the election and the change of prime minister | Labour has governed continuously since 4 July 2024 under two leaders |

**Three parties in this chamber did not exist when the dataset's Labour entry was written**, which is
a good measure of how far behind it had fallen: **Your Party** (founded 24 July 2025, 2 MPs),
**Restore Britain** (a pressure group from 30 June 2025, a registered party from 13 February 2026,
1 MP), and the Liberal Democrats' and SDLP's own articles have been refounded under 2025 titles.

**Sinn Féin is included, with its abstention stated.** Its seven MPs are elected but do not take
their seats; leaving the party out would misrepresent seven Northern Irish constituencies as
unrepresented, and including it silently would misrepresent the Commons arithmetic. The party's
source line says so explicitly.

**Documented gap — 13 of the 650 seats**: 7 independents, the 4-MP **Independent Alliance** (a
parliamentary grouping of independents rather than a registered party), the **Speaker** (who sits
apart from party), and **1 vacancy**.

**Eleven non-free logos, declared.** Only four UK party logos (Reform UK, SDLP, Your Party, Alliance)
are on Commons. The rest are English Wikipedia local files: eight under a fair-use rationale and
three (Conservative, SNP, UUP) held as public domain because the marks fall below the UK threshold of
originality. Each carries a `licenceNote` saying which of the two it is — the notes are not
interchangeable, and writing "fair use" over a public-domain file would be as wrong as the reverse.

All fifteen logos were montage-verified.

### 🇺🇸 United States — audited 2026-09-12

The United States had **two presidents at once**. `US-DEM` carried
`leader: "Kamala Harris", leaderTitle: "President (2025–present)"` and `US-REP` carried
`leader: "Donald Trump", leaderTitle: "President (2025–present)"`, and **both** were marked
`inPower: true` **and** `inExecutive: true` with `timeInPower: "2025-present"`. Two parties cannot
simultaneously hold the same single-occupant office, so this was not a stale fact that time
overtook — it was internally contradictory the day it was written. Kamala Harris has never been
president.

| ID | Sev | Field | Was | Now | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PP-130 | **S1** | `leader` / `leaderTitle` | **both parties' leaders titled "President (2025–present)"**; the Democratic one named **Kamala Harris** | **Donald Trump, "U.S. President"** for the Republicans; **Ken Martin, "Chair of the Democratic National Committee"** for the Democrats | Donald Trump has been president since 20 January 2025. Each party's own infobox: the Republicans list the president as their leader; the Democrats, holding no such office, list their DNC chair first |
| PP-131 | **S1** | `inPower` / `inExecutive` | **true on both parties** | **true on the Republicans only** | Only one party holds the presidency and the House majority |
| PP-132 | **S1** | `seats` | Democratic **222**, Republican **213** — the majority on the wrong side | **Republican 218, Democratic 214** | The House's own composition for the 119th Congress. The old figures reversed control of the chamber |
| PP-133 | **S2** | `logo` | 2016-era marks | the **2025** Democratic logo and the current GOP mark | Each party's own infobox image |
| PP-134 | **S3** | `ideology` | generic | copied from each party's own infobox | The Republican entry now records right-wing populism with a conservative faction; the Democratic, liberalism |

**A deliberate asymmetry, recorded.** American parties have no single "leader" post. English
Wikipedia's Republican infobox lists the **U.S. President** as the party's first leadership entry;
the Democratic infobox, with no such officeholder, leads with the **DNC chair**. The dataset follows
each source rather than forcing a symmetry neither party has.

**Documented gap — 3 of the 435 seats**: **2 vacancies** and **1 independent** (Kevin Kiley, elected
as a Republican, who caucuses with them but sits as an independent). No third party holds a House
seat, so the two entries are full coverage of the chamber's parties.

Both logos are public domain on Commons and were montage-verified.

### 🇨🇦 Canada — audited 2026-09-12

Canada had **one party**, led by a prime minister who left office in 2025, sitting in a House of
Commons that no longer has that many seats.

The 45th Parliament was elected on 28 April 2025 into a **343-seat** chamber (redistribution added
five seats): **Liberal 173** (government), **Conservative 138** (Official Opposition), **Bloc

**Documented gap — 5 of the 343 seats are vacancies.** No other party holds a Commons seat, so these
five entries are full coverage of the chamber's parties.

**Two non-free logos, declared.** The Liberal Party's mark is a fair-use file on English Wikipedia;
the Bloc Québécois's is held there as public domain (below the threshold of originality). Each
carries the matching `licenceNote`. The Conservative, NDP and Green logos are on Commons.

All five logos were montage-verified.

## Phase 4 complete — United Kingdom, United States, Canada

Three of the world's most-viewed democracies, and all three were wrong in a way a reader would
notice immediately:

* **The UK** had one party and no opposition at all, led by a former prime minister.
* **The US** had **two simultaneous presidents**, one of whom has never held the office, and showed
  House control on the wrong side.
* **Canada** had one party, a prime minister who left in 2025, and a chamber size retired at the
  2025 election.

Coverage across the three went from **4 parties to 22**.

## Phase 5 — Europe

### 🇩🇪 Germany — audited 2026-09-12

Germany had **one party**: the CDU, with **258** seats — a figure that belongs to no Bundestag. The
CDU/CSU group won 208 seats in 2025 and the CDU's own share is **164**; 258 appears to conflate the
group with something else again.

The 21st Bundestag, elected 23 February 2025, has 630 seats: **Government (Merz cabinet) 328** —
CDU 164, CSU 44, SPD 120 — and **Opposition 302** — AfD 150, Greens 85, Die Linke 64, and 3
non-attached.

| ID | Sev | Field | Was | Now | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PP-140 | **S1** | `seats` | CDU **258** | **164** | The Bundestag's own composition. 258 matches neither the CDU nor the CDU/CSU group (208) |
| PP-141 | **S1** | coverage | 1 party | **6 parties, 627 of 630** | The **AfD**, the largest opposition party with 150 seats, was absent, as were the SPD — the CDU's own coalition partner, with 120 — the Greens, Die Linke and the CSU |
| PP-142 | **S2** | `inExecutive` | absent | **true** on the CDU, CSU and SPD | The three parties of the Merz cabinet |
| PP-143 | **S3** | coalitions | none | **`DE-GOV`** (CDU/CSU–SPD, 328 seats) | The Bundestag's own Government grouping |

**The CDU/CSU relationship is modelled explicitly rather than flattened.** They are two separate
parties that never contest each other's territory — the CSU stands only in Bavaria — and sit as a
single group in the Bundestag. Both are entered separately with their own seat counts, and the
`DE-GOV` coalition note explains the arrangement. Merging them into one "CDU/CSU" entry would have
hidden a real party; treating the group's 208 seats as the CDU's would have been the 258 error again.

**Documented gap — 3 of the 630 seats are non-attached members**, including the SSW's single
representative, who sits outside every group.

All six logos are public domain on Commons and were montage-verified.

### 🇫🇷 France — audited 2026-09-12

France had **one entry**, and it was not a party. `FR-ENSEMBLE` — "Ensemble pour la République",
250 seats, led by Gabriel Attal — is a **parliamentary group**, and its 250 seats belong to a
legislature that no longer exists: the group now holds 92.

| ID | Sev | Field | Was | Now | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PP-144 | **S1** | existence | a **parliamentary group** modelled as a party, with 250 seats | **13 parties** with their own seat counts | The Assembly's own composition gives a per-party breakdown inside each group; EPR now holds 92, of which Renaissance's own share is 87 |
| PP-145 | **S1** | coverage | 1 entry | **13 parties, 513 of 577** | The **Rassemblement National**, the largest single party in the chamber with 115 seats, was absent, as were LFI, the PS, LR and nine others |
| PP-146 | **S1** | `inExecutive` | **false** on the one entry marked `inPower: true` | **true** on Renaissance, MoDem and Horizons | The three parties of the second Lecornu government. An entry that is in power but in no executive describes nothing |
| PP-147 | **S3** | coalitions | none | **`FR-GOV`** (Renaissance, MoDem, Horizons — 162 seats) | The Assembly's own Government grouping |

**A modelling decision, recorded.** France's Assembly reports composition by **group**, and each
group contains several parties — the EPR group's 92 seats are Renaissance's 87 plus five deputies
from four other parties, and Les Républicains' 48 seats are split across three different groups. The
dataset models **parties**, not groups, because that is what the feature is, and because every party
has a logo where a group does not. Each party's seat figure is the sum of its own deputies across
every group, taken from the Assembly article's per-group breakdown. The `FR-GOV` coalition carries
the group-level picture, including the note that Les Républicains *support* the government without
being in it — the same reading applied in Indonesia and Peru.

**Documented gap — 64 of the 577 seats**: nine non-attached members, and deputies of the small
overseas, regional and miscellaneous-right/left groupings (DVD, DVG, Péyi-A, Tāvini, Tapura,
Caledonian Union, Place Publique, L'Après and some twenty others), most holding one or two seats and
many with no logo file anywhere.

**Four non-free logos, declared** (PS, Les Écologistes, Génération.s, L'Avenir Français); the other
nine are on Commons. All thirteen were montage-verified.

### 🇮🇹 Italy — audited 2026-09-12

Italy's six parties were the right six, but **Forza Italia was led by Silvio Berlusconi, who died in
June 2023** — the second deceased leader this sweep has found in production, after Vietnam's. Every
seat figure was also from the 2022 election night rather than the current chamber.

| ID | Sev | Field | Was | Now | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PP-148 | **S1** | `leader` | Forza Italia led by **Silvio Berlusconi** | **Antonio Tajani** | Berlusconi died on 12 June 2023; Tajani has been Forza Italia's national secretary since |
| PP-149 | **S1** | `seats` | FdI 115, PD 69, M5S 63, Lega **30**, FI 37, AVS 13 | **FdI 117, PD 68, M5S 48, Lega 57, FI 52, AVS 10** | The Chamber's own composition. The Lega figure was out by 27 seats and the M5S by 15 |
| PP-150 | **S2** | coverage | 6 parties, 327 of 400 | **12 parties, 389 of 400** | Added Azione (10), **Futuro Nazionale** (8), Italia Viva (7), Noi Moderati (7), SVP (3) and Più Europa (2) |
| PP-151 | **S2** | `founded` | Lega **1991** | **2017** | 1991 is Lega Nord's founding year; Lega per Salvini Premier is a distinct party registered on 14 December 2017 |
| PP-152 | **S2** | `inExecutive` | absent on all | **true** on FdI, Lega and Forza Italia | The three parties of the Meloni cabinet |
| PP-153 | **S3** | coalitions | none | **`IT-CDX`** (centre-right, 227 seats) | The Chamber's own Government grouping |

**Futuro Nazionale did not exist when the old entries were written** — Roberto Vannacci's party was
founded on 6 February 2026 and already holds 8 Chamber seats, more than Italia Viva or Noi Moderati.

**Noi Moderati is `inPower` but outside the coalition**, because the Chamber lists it under
*supported by* rather than as part of the government — the same confidence-and-supply reading applied
in Indonesia, Peru and France.

**Documented gap — 11 of the 400 seats**: the remaining Mixed-group deputies (Valdostan Union, the
Italian Radicals, Sardinian Progressives, DemoS, Christian Democracy with Rotondi and the
non-inscrits), each holding one or two seats.

**Seven non-free logos, declared**; five are on Commons. All twelve were montage-verified.

### 🇪🇸 Spain — audited 2026-09-12

Spain had **one party — and it was the opposition, marked as governing.** `ES-PP` carried
`inPower: true` with `inExecutive: false`, a combination that describes nothing: the People's Party
leads the **Opposition**, and the PSOE, which actually governs, was not in the dataset.

The Congress of Deputies, 350 seats: **Government 147** (PSOE 121, the Sumar group 26), **supported
by 24** (ERC 7, EH Bildu 6, PNV 5, Mixed 6), **Opposition 179** (PP 137, Vox 32, Junts 7, Mixed 3).

| ID | Sev | Field | Was | Now | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PP-154 | **S1** | `inPower` | **true on the People's Party**, Spain's opposition, with `inExecutive: false` | **false on the PP**; true on the PSOE and its partners | The Congress's own Government/Opposition grouping. The PP has not held the premiership since 2018 |
| PP-155 | **S1** | coverage | 1 party | **14 parties, 346 of 350** | The **PSOE**, the governing party with 121 seats, was absent, as was **Vox** with 32, and eleven others |
| PP-156 | **S2** | `seats` | PP **136** | **137** | The Congress's own composition |
| PP-157 | **S3** | coalitions | none | **`ES-GOV`** (PSOE + the five Sumar-group parties) | The Congress's own Government grouping |

**The Sumar group is unpacked into its parties.** Its 26 seats belong to six different parties —
Movimiento Sumar 11, Catalunya en Comú 6, Izquierda Unida 5, Más Madrid 2, Compromís 1, Més per
Mallorca 1 — so each is entered with its own count rather than the group's, the same treatment given
to France's parliamentary groups.

**Five parties are `inPower` without being in the coalition**: ERC, EH Bildu, the PNV and the BNG
support the government on confidence and supply without cabinet office. Podemos, which left the
government bloc, is recorded out of power. The same reading as Indonesia, Peru, France and Italy.

**Documented gap — 4 of the 350 seats**: Més per Mallorca, Navarrese People's Union, Coalición
Canaria and one further Mixed-group deputy, each holding a single seat.

All fourteen logos are on Commons and were montage-verified.

### 🇵🇱 Poland — audited 2026-09-12

Poland had **one party, and it was the fourth-largest member of the governing coalition** — the PSL,
with 28 of the Sejm's 460 seats. The Civic Coalition, which leads the government with 153, and Law
and Justice, the opposition with 140, were both absent.

The Sejm: **Government (Tusk III) 239** — KO 156, Polish Coalition 32, The Left 21, Centre Union 15,
Poland 2050 15 — **supported by 4**, **Opposition 217** — PiS 146, Development Plus 41,
Confederation 16, Razem 4, Direct Democracy 4.

| ID | Sev | Field | Was | Now | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PP-158 | **S1** | coverage | 1 party — a junior coalition partner | **11 parties, 433 of 460** | The **Civic Coalition** (153) and **Law and Justice** (140) were both absent: the party of the prime minister and the party of the opposition |
| PP-159 | **S2** | `seats` | PSL **30** | **28** | The Sejm's own composition; the Polish Coalition group's 32 seats include three Centre for Poland deputies and one independent |
| PP-160 | **S2** | `inExecutive` | absent | **true** on the five coalition parties | The Tusk III cabinet |
| PP-161 | **S3** | coalitions | none | **`PL-GOV`** (239 seats) | The Sejm's own Government grouping |

**Two parties in this Sejm are younger than the dataset entry they were missing from.** **Development
Plus** — Mateusz Morawiecki's party, now the second-largest opposition force with 40 seats — was
founded on 15 April 2026, and the **Centre Union** became a registered party on 12 July 2026, two
months before this audit. Both are in the chamber today.

**The Confederation group is unpacked**: its 16 seats are New Hope's 8 and the National Movement's 7,
two distinct parties, entered separately.

**Documented gap — 27 of the 460 seats**: the Direct Democracy group (Kukiz'15 and others), Centre
for Poland, the Greens, AGROunia, Free Republicans, and the independents and non-aligned deputies
spread across the government and opposition groups.

**Three non-free logos, declared** (New Hope and Odnowa under fair use, the Centre Union as a local
public-domain file); the other eight are on Commons. All eleven were montage-verified.

### 🌍 Rule change and cross-country logo backfill — 2026-09-12

**The owner directed that the mandatory-logo rule be relaxed from a MUST to a SHOULD**, that the
parties it had kept out be added back, and that the logo search be widened beyond Wikimedia to the
regional *Elects* network (EuropeElects, AsiaElects, AfricaElects, OceaniaElects, LatamElects) and
the parties' own sites. All three are done, and `CLAUDE.md` now carries the rewritten rule.

**Why the old rule was wrong.** `GRANDFATHERED_PARTIES_WITH_NO_IMAGE` failed the build on any party
added after 2026-09-08 without a bundled logo. It did not produce better images; it produced
**missing parties** — and an omission the reader cannot see makes an incomplete chamber look
complete, which is the Torres Strait Islander Flag lesson in a new place. The gate now enforces the
RESEARCH: `noImageReason` is allowed on any party, but must be ≥60 characters and must name at least
two of eight searched source families. `founded` became optional for the same reason.

| ID | Sev | What | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| PP-162 | **S1** | The mandatory-logo gate | Replaced by a research gate. `GRANDFATHERED_PARTIES_WITH_NO_IMAGE` deleted; `NO_IMAGE_SOURCE_FAMILIES` + a 60-character floor replace it |
| PP-163 | **S1** | `founded` was mandatory | Now optional; `PoliticalPartyFacts` omits the row rather than rendering `undefined` |
| PP-164 | **S1** | **13 real, seated parties were missing** purely for want of a logo or a founding year | **All 13 added** — see the table below |
| PP-165 | **S1** | **`DK-F` "Free Democrats" (Denmark), 50 seats** | **Removed — the party does not exist.** Its cited article `Free Democrats (Denmark)` is *missing* on Wikipedia. Deleting it also fixes Denmark's impossible **197-of-179** total, which drops to 147/179 |
| PP-166 | **S2** | 58 parties carried `noImageReason` | **39 now have a real, montage-verified logo**; the remaining 19 carry a reason naming what was swept |

**The 13 parties restored** (every one holds seats):

| Country | Party | Seats | Logo? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🇨🇴 Colombia | Partido Demócrata Colombiano | 3 | ✅ (no founding year — none is sourceable) |
| 🇨🇴 Colombia | Colombia Renaciente | 2 | ✅ |
| 🇨🇴 Colombia | La Fuerza de las Regiones | 1 | ✅ |
| 🇨🇴 Colombia | Unidad en Minga por Colombia | 1 | ✅ |
| 🇻🇪 Venezuela | Vamos, Vamos Cojedes | 5 | — social-media only |
| 🇨🇱 Chile | Federación Regionalista Verde Social | 2 | — empty infobox image field |
| 🇧🇴 Bolivia | Consejo Indígena Yuqui Bia Recuate | 1 | ✅ (no founding year) |
| 🇬🇾 Guyana | Forward Guyana Movement | 1 | — no article anywhere |
| 🇸🇷 Suriname | Alternatief 2020 | 1 | — empty infobox logo field |
| 🇵🇭 Philippines | Centrist Democratic Party | 1 | — infobox logo field is the broken literal `200px` |
| 🇵🇭 Philippines | Partido Navoteño | 1 | — no logo field |
| 🇹🇭 Thailand | New Dimension Party | 1 | — no article anywhere |
| 🇹🇭 Thailand | Thai Sup Thawee Party | 1 | — no article anywhere |

**Four countries now reconcile EXACTLY** as a result: Bolivia **130/130**, Guyana **65/65**,
Suriname **51/51**, Argentina **257/257**.

**The country constraint is the whole game.** The first backfill pass matched parties by NAME against
Wikidata and produced precisely the collisions this repository exists to prevent — **Spain's Vox on
an Argentine bloc; Romania's Social Democrats on both Korea's and Nigeria's; Sweden's Vänsterpartiet
on Norway's SV; Finland's Keskusta on Norway's Sp; the German Greens on Norway's MDG; the
Netherlands' SP on Portugal's PS; a photograph of a politician, the Buenos Aires Underground logo and
the flag of Argentina** on three more. Re-running it as a SPARQL query constrained by `P17` (country)
and accepting only exact name/alias matches removed every one. That constraint is now written into
`CLAUDE.md` rule 2.

**And the montage caught three that survived every mechanical check**: Open Vld resolved to a bare
blue circle, **Vlaams Belang got the logo of Vlaams Blok** — the banned predecessor it replaced in
2004 — and "Party of Life" got Reiwa Shinsengumi's. All three were corrected by hand.

**Logos added, by country**: Belgium 9, Norway 9, Denmark 7, Switzerland 3, Argentina 3, Greece 2,
Portugal 2, Thailand 3, Japan 1, Kenya 1, South Korea 1, plus the four Colombian and one Bolivian
re-adds. 44 in total, every one montage-verified.

**Two findings logged for the countries they belong to** (not fixed here — they need their own
audit): **Belgium's SP.a renamed itself Vooruit** and **Open Vld renamed itself Anders**, so both
cards now show a logo whose wordmark does not match the `shortName` beside it. **Norway's seats sum
to 191 of 169** — another impossible total, waiting for the Norway audit.

### 🇳🇱 Netherlands — audited 2026-09-12

The Netherlands held five parties on the **2023** election result, with the VVD led by **Derk Jan
Eppink** — who is a **JA21/FvD** politician, not a VVD one, the same wrong-party-leader defect found
in Colombia. Every seat figure was superseded by the 29 October 2025 election, and the party that now
leads the government was carried as an opposition entry.

The House of Representatives, 150 seats: **Government (Jetten cabinet) 66** — D66 26, VVD 22,
CDA 18 — and **Opposition 84**, led by Progressief Nederland's 20 and the PVV's 19.

| ID | Sev | Field | Was | Now | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PP-167 | **S1** | `leader` | VVD led by **Derk Jan Eppink** | **Dilan Yeşilgöz** | Eppink is a JA21 politician; the VVD's leader is Yeşilgöz. A leader attached to the wrong party, as in Colombia |
| PP-168 | **S1** | `seats` | VVD 35, PVV 37, CDA 27, SP 25, D66 21 | **VVD 22, PVV 19, CDA 18, SP 3, D66 26** | The chamber's own composition. The **SP fell from 25 to 3** and the PVV from 37 to 19 |
| PP-169 | **S1** | `inPower` | VVD, PVV, CDA and D66 all in power; none in the executive | **D66, VVD and CDA in power and in the executive; the PVV in opposition** | The PVV left government in 2024 and is now the second-largest opposition party |
| PP-170 | **S2** | coverage | 5 parties, 145 of a chamber whose seats they no longer hold | **15 parties, 142 of 150** | Ten seated parties were absent, including **Progressief Nederland**, the largest opposition party with 20 seats |
| PP-171 | **S3** | coalitions | none | **`NL-GOV`** (D66 + VVD + CDA, 66 seats — a minority government) | The chamber's own Government grouping |

**Progressief Nederland did not exist under that name when the old entries were written**: the
GroenLinks–PvdA alliance became a single party on 1 July 2026, and the entry records the previous
name. Rob Jetten (D66) has been prime minister since 23 February 2026.

**Documented gap — 8 of the 150 seats**: the **Markuszower Group** (7) and the **Keijzer Group** (1),
both splinter groups of deputies rather than registered parties.

**Fifteen orphan logo files** were already sitting in `public/party-logos/nl/` from an earlier PR,
unreferenced by any entry. They have been replaced with a freshly fetched, montage-verified set.

**Two non-free logos, declared** (Progressief Nederland, PVV); the other thirteen are on Commons.

### 🇧🇪 Belgium — audited 2026-09-12

Belgium's nine parties included **two that have since renamed themselves**, which the logo backfill
had already flagged: the cards read **SP.a** and **Open Vld** while the logos beside them read
**Vooruit** and **Anders**. Three seated parties were missing, and `inPower` described the previous
government rather than the De Wever coalition sworn in on 3 February 2025.

The Chamber, 150 seats: **Government 80** — N-VA 23, MR 18, Les Engagés 15, Vooruit 13, CD&V 11 —
one supporting independent, **Opposition 69** — VB 20, PS 16, PVDA-PTB 15, Anders 8, Groen 6,

**Documented gap — 1 of the 150 seats**: the independent deputy who supports the government without
belonging to a party.

**Three non-free logos, declared** (Vlaams Belang, Les Engagés, DéFI); the other nine are on Commons.
All twelve were montage-verified — and Vlaams Belang's is the file corrected by hand in the backfill,
after the automated pass had handed it the logo of **Vlaams Blok**, the banned predecessor party it
replaced in 2004.

### 🇳🇴 Norway — audited 2026-09-12

Norway's nine parties summed to **191 seats in a 169-seat Storting** — the fourth impossible total
this sweep has found, flagged during the 2026-09-12 logo backfill. Every seat figure and **eight of
the nine leaders** were superseded by the September 2025 election.

The Storting: **Government 53** — Labour alone, as a minority — **supported by 35** (Socialist Left
9, Centre 9, Red 9, Green 8), **Opposition 81** (Progress 47, Conservative 24, Christian Democratic
7, Liberal 3).

| PP-179 | **S1** | the chamber's shape | Conservative 45, Progress 36 | **Progress 47, Conservative 24** | The 2025 election turned the Progress Party into the largest opposition party and **halved the Conservatives**. The old figures had them the other way round |
| PP-180 | **S1** | `leader` | **eight of nine wrong** — Støre, Solberg, Listhaug, Lysbakken, Moxnes, Hansson, Ropstad … | Brenna, Søviknes, Eriksen Søreide, Bergstø, Sneve Martinussen, Liland, Ulstein … | Each party's own article. Only the Centre Party's Trygve Slagsvold Vedum was still correct |
| PP-181 | **S1** | `inPower` | Labour **and the Centre Party** in government | **Labour alone in the executive**; Socialist Left, Centre, Red and Green in power as confidence-and-supply | The Centre Party left the government in early 2025; Labour has governed as a minority since |
| PP-182 | **S2** | `founded` | Red Party **1990** | **2007** | 1990 is its predecessor's year; the Red Party was founded 11 March 2007 |
| PP-183 | **S2** | `chamberName` | "Parliament" | **"Storting"** | The chamber's own name |

**Jonas Gahr Støre is still prime minister** — he was the one leadership fact the entry had right,
but it was attached to the wrong field: he had been recorded as Labour's *party* leader, which is now
Tonje Brenna.

All nine logos were added in the 2026-09-12 backfill and montage-verified. Norway is the fifth
country in this sweep to reconcile **exactly**.

### 🇸🇪 Sweden — audited 2026-09-12

Sweden held **four parties covering 236 of 349 seats**, on figures from the 2022 election, with the
governing coalition's two junior partners and the entire left of the chamber absent. The Social
Democrats — the largest party in the Riksdag, with 106 seats — were carried at **67**.

The Riksdag: **Government 103** (Moderates 66, Christian Democrats 19, Liberals 16, two non-attached
Sweden Democrats), **supported by 73** (Sweden Democrats 70, Ambition Sweden 2, one Christian

| PP-186 | **S1** | `leader` | S led by **Magdalena Andersson**, SD by **Jimmie Åkesson**, V by **Nooshi Dadgostar** | **Lena Hallengren, Mattias Bäckström Johansson, Samuel Gonzalez Westling** | Each party's own article. Only the Moderates' Ulf Kristersson was still correct |
| PP-187 | **S1** | `inPower` | **Moderates only**, with the Sweden Democrats out of power | Moderates, Christian Democrats and Liberals in the executive; **Sweden Democrats and Ambition Sweden in power** on confidence and supply | The Tidö Agreement: the SD is the government's largest supporting party and was recorded as opposition |
| PP-188 | **S2** | `founded` | Centre Party absent; V **1917** | 1913; V **1917** confirmed | party infoboxes |
| PP-189 | **S3** | coalitions | none | **`SE-GOV`** (the Tidö coalition, 103 seats) | The Riksdag's own Government grouping |

**Three parties in this Riksdag were founded in 2025** and could not have been in the old entries:
**Ambition Sweden** (June 2025, 2 seats, supporting the government), **Unity** (August 2025, 1) and
**Future Left** (December 2025, 3).

**Seven non-free logos, declared**; four are on Commons. All eleven were montage-verified. Sweden is
the sixth country in this sweep to reconcile **exactly**.

### 🇩🇰 Denmark — audited 2026-09-12

Denmark's headline defect was already fixed during the 2026-09-12 rule change: **`DK-F` "Free
Democrats", credited with 50 of 179 seats, is a party that does not exist** — its cited Wikipedia
article is missing — and removing it dropped Denmark's impossible **197-of-179** total to 147. This
audit finishes the country on the 24 March 2026 election.

The Folketing: **Government (Frederiksen III) 82** — Social Democrats 38, Green Left 20, Moderates
14, Social Liberals 10 — **supported by 20**, **Opposition 77** — Venstre 18, Danish People's 16,
Liberal Alliance 15, Conservatives 13, Denmark Democrats 10, Citizens' 1, 4 independents.

| ID | Sev | Field | Was | Now | Evidence |

| PP-198 | **S3** | coalitions | none | **`DK-GOV`** (Frederiksen III, 82 seats — a minority government) | The Folketing's own Government grouping |

**Documented gap — 8 of the 179 seats**: the **four North Atlantic members** (two Faroese, two
Greenlandic, elected on their own islands' party lists) and **four independents**.

All twelve logos are public domain on Commons and were montage-verified.

### 🇮🇪 Ireland — audited 2026-09-12

**Every one of Ireland's three logo files was a Wikimedia error page, not an image.**
`fianna-fail.svg`, `fine-gael.svg` and `sinn-fein.svg` were each 2,256 bytes of
`<!DOCTYPE html><title>Wikimedia Error</title>…` saved under an `.svg` extension. All three
were shipping to users, and all three rendered broken — the whole country's grid was empty
boxes. This is the same class as Timor-Leste's audio file and Indonesia's wrong-company logo,
and it is why `getlogo.mjs` now refuses any download whose first bytes are HTML.

The Dáil was also the wrong size. The **Electoral (Amendment) Act 2023 raised the Dáil from 160
to 174 seats** for the 2024 general election; the entries still carried `seatsTotal: 160`, so
every percentage the widget rendered was computed against a chamber that no longer exists.

The 34th Dáil, 174 seats: **Government 90** — Fianna Fáil 48, Fine Gael 38, independents 4 —
**supported by 3** independents, **Opposition 80** — Sinn Féin 39, Social Democrats 12, Labour
11, Independent Ireland 4, PBP–Solidarity 3, Aontú 2, Green Party 1, 100% Redress 1,
independents 7 — plus the Ceann Comhairle.

| ID | Sev | Field | Was | Now | Evidence |

| PP-199 | **S1** | `logo` | **all three files were Wikimedia HTML error pages** saved as `.svg` | ten real, montage-verified logos | The bundled bytes begin `<!DOCTYPE html>`; a browser renders nothing. Verified by reading the files, then by re-rendering the replacements |
| PP-200 | **S1** | `seatsTotal` | **160** | **174** | The Dáil was enlarged by the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2023 and 174 TDs were returned on 29 November 2024 |
| PP-201 | **S1** | `seats` | FF **78**, FG 37, SF 37 | **FF 48, SF 39, FG 38** | The 34th Dáil's own composition table. Fianna Fáil was overstated by 30 seats — more than the entire Fine Gael parliamentary party |
| PP-202 | **S3** | coverage | 3 parties, 152 seats | **10 parties, 159 of 174** | Seven seated parties were absent: the Social Democrats (12), Labour (11), Independent Ireland (4), PBP–Solidarity (3), Aontú (2), the Green Party (1) and 100% Redress (1) |
| PP-203 | **S2** | `inPower` / `inExecutive` | FF and FG in power, **`inExecutive` absent on both** | `inExecutive: true` on Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael | The 35th government, formed 23 January 2025, is an FF–FG coalition; its independent supporters hold office only at minister-of-state rank. This closes defect **B6** for Ireland |
| PP-204 | **S2** | `leaderTitle` | all three "Party Leader" | **"Leader"** for Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, the Social Democrats, Labour, Independent Ireland, Aontú and the Greens; **"President"** for Sinn Féin; **"Chairperson"** for 100% Redress | Each party's own infobox. Sinn Féin's leader holds the office of *President*, not "Party Leader" |
| PP-205 | **S6** | `positionRaw` / `ideologyPosition` | FF "Centre-right"; SF "Left-wing" | FF **"Centre to centre-right"**; SF **"Centre-left to left-wing"** | Each party's cited position, copied verbatim rather than flattened |
| PP-206 | **S3** | coalitions | none | **`IE-GOV`** (the 35th government, Fianna Fáil + Fine Gael) | The government's own article |

**A leader field left deliberately empty.** People Before Profit–Solidarity's infobox gives its
leader as *"Collective leadership"* — a description, not a person. Following the Thailand lesson
(**PP-028**, a 130-character sentence rendered to users as a leader's name), the field is omitted
rather than filled with prose.

**Documented gap — 15 of the 174 seats**: **14 independents** and the **Ceann Comhairle**, who by
convention sits apart from party politics. Neither is a party.

**Aontú is `other`, not a point on the left–right axis.** Its own cited position is *"Fiscal:
left-wing; social: right-wing"* — two positions, not a range — so flattening it to either would
misstate the source. `other` is what that field is for.

**Six logos are on Commons; four (Fine Gael, Sinn Féin, PBP–Solidarity, Aontú) are non-free files
held on English Wikipedia and are declared with `licenceNote`s.** All ten were montage-verified
before bundling.

### 🇵🇹 Portugal — audited 2026-09-12

Portugal held **two parties**, and the one marked as governing has been in opposition since April
2024. **`PT-PS` carried 120 seats; the Socialist Party holds 58** — overstated by 62, more than the
entire Chega parliamentary party. The governing Social Democrats, with 89, were not in the dataset
at all.

The Assembly of the Republic, 230 seats, after the 18 May 2025 election: **Government (XXV
Constitutional) 91** — PSD 89, CDS–PP 2 — **Opposition 139** — Chega 60, PS 58, IL 9, LIVRE 6,
PCP 3, BE 1, PAN 1, JPP 1.

| ID | Sev | Field | Was | Now | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PP-207 | **S1** | `seats` | PS **120**, BE **12** | **PS 58, BE 1** | The Assembly's own composition after the 18 May 2025 election. Both figures predate two general elections |
| PP-208 | **S1** | `inPower` | **PS true** | **false**; PSD and CDS–PP true and `inExecutive` | The Socialist Party left office in April 2024. The XXV Constitutional Government, formed 5 June 2025, is a PSD–CDS–PP minority coalition under Luís Montenegro |
| PP-209 | **S1** | `leader` | PS **Pedro Nuno Santos**; BE **Mariana Mortágua** | **José Luís Carneiro**; **José Manuel Pureza** | Santos resigned after the May 2025 defeat; each party's own infobox |
| PP-210 | **S3** | coverage | 2 parties, 132 of 230 | **10 parties, 230 of 230 exactly** | Eight seated parties were absent, including the governing **PSD (89)** and **Chega (60)** |

| PP-212 | **S2** | `leaderTitle` | "Party Leader" on both | **President** (PSD, Chega, IL, CDS–PP, JPP), **Secretary-General** (PS), **General Secretary** (PCP), **Coordinator of the Political Commission** (BE), **Spokespersons** (LIVRE) | Portuguese parties do not share one leadership office, and the widget renders the title verbatim |
| PP-213 | **S3** | coalitions | none | **`PT-GOV`** (XXV Constitutional Government, 91 of 230 — a minority coalition) | The government's own article |
| PP-214 | **S6** | `ideology`, `positionRaw` | PS "Social democracy / Progressivism / Pro-EU", position "Centre-left"; BE position "Left" | each party's cited list and position, verbatim (BE: "Left-wing to far-left") | Flattened ranges restored to the source's own wording |

**Chega is now the largest opposition party**, at 60 seats against the Socialists' 58 — the first
time since the Carnation Revolution that neither PS nor PSD leads the opposition. The old two-party
dataset could not express that at all.

**Documented gap — none.** Portugal is the **seventh country in this sweep to reconcile exactly**:
all 230 seats belong to one of the ten parties, with no independents and no unmodelled groups.

**A logo double-checked because it looked wrong.** LIVRE's emblem is a red poppy with a black,
paw-like centre, which reads at thumbnail size like an animal-rights symbol rather than a green
party's. It was confirmed against **two independent infoboxes** — English Wikipedia's
`Logo of the LIVRE.svg` and Portuguese Wikipedia's `Partido LIVRE logo.png` — which carry the same
design from different uploads. Six logos are on Commons; four (Chega, PS, PAN, JPP) are non-free
files held on English Wikipedia and are declared with `licenceNote`s. All ten were montage-verified.

### 🇱🇺 Luxembourg — audited 2026-09-12

Luxembourg's three parties carried **three leaders, and two of them lead a different party**. `LU-CSV`
was led by **Claude Haagen**, an LSAP politician, and `LU-LSAP` by **François Benoy**, a co-leader of
the Greens — the same wrong-party-leader defect found in Colombia, the Netherlands and Denmark, but
twice in one country of three entries. Every seat figure was also wrong, and the opposition's largest
party was marked as governing.

The Chamber of Deputies, 60 seats: **Government (Frieden-Bettel) 35** — CSV 21, DP 14 —
**Opposition 25** — LSAP 12, ADR 5, Greens 4, Pirates 2, The Left 2.

| ID | Sev | Field | Was | Now | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PP-220 | **S1** | `leader` | CSV led by **Claude Haagen**; LSAP by **François Benoy** | **Luc Frieden**; **Georges Engel and Maxime Miltgen** | Haagen is an LSAP politician and Benoy a Green co-leader. Frieden has been CSV president — and prime minister — since 2023 |
| PP-221 | **S1** | `seats` | DP **21**, CSV **13**, LSAP **10** | **CSV 21, DP 14, LSAP 12** | The Chamber's own composition after the 8 October 2023 election. The 21 belonged to the CSV, not the DP — the two largest parties' figures were swapped |
| PP-222 | **S1** | `inPower` | all three true | **CSV and DP true and `inExecutive`; LSAP false** | The LSAP left government in 2023 and is the largest opposition party |
| PP-223 | **S3** | coverage | 3 parties, 44 of 60 | **7 parties, 60 of 60 exactly** | Four seated parties were absent: the ADR (5), the Greens (4), the Pirates (2) and The Left (2) |
| PP-224 | **S2** | `leaderTitle` | absent | **President** (CSV), **Leader** (DP, ADR), **Presidents** (LSAP), **Co-leaders** (Greens), **Spokespersons** (Pirates) | Each party's own infobox |
| PP-225 | **S3** | coalitions | none | **`LU-GOV`** (Frieden-Bettel, 35 of 60) | The Chamber's own Government grouping |

**A leader field left deliberately empty.** Déi Lénk's infobox gives its leader as *"Collective
leadership"* — a description, not a person — so the field is omitted, as for Ireland's PBP–Solidarity
and Portugal's PAN.

**The Pirates are `other`, not a point on the left–right axis.** Their cited position is *"Syncretic"*,
which is what that bucket is for.

**Documented gap — none.** Luxembourg is the **eighth country in this sweep to reconcile exactly**.

All seven logos are on Commons and were montage-verified; the CSV, DP and LSAP files were the three
recovered hours earlier in the cross-country broken-image sweep below, where they were Wikimedia error
pages.

### 🇨🇭 Switzerland — audited 2026-09-12

Switzerland's three parties were led by **Karin Keller-Sutter** (recorded as leading the Social
Democrats — she is an **FDP** federal councillor, and was President of the Confederation in 2025),
**Marco Chiesa** (SVP president until 2024) and **Beatrice Kappeler** (a journalist, not an FDP
office-holder). All three were also marked `inPower: true` with **`inExecutive: false`** — a
combination that describes nothing, and one that is especially wrong here, because Switzerland's
executive is the one place in this dataset where "in power" is a permanent, structural fact.

The National Council, 200 seats: **SVP 62, SP 41, The Centre 29, FDP 28, Greens 23, GLP 10, MCG 2,
EVP 2, EDU 2, Ticino League 1.**

| ID | Sev | Field | Was | Now | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PP-226 | **S1** | `leader` | SP led by **Karin Keller-Sutter**; SVP by **Marco Chiesa**; FDP by **Beatrice Kappeler** | **Cédric Wermuth and Mattea Meyer**; **Marcel Dettling**; **Susanne Vincenz-Stauffacher and Benjamin Mühlemann** | Keller-Sutter is an FDP federal councillor, not the SP's leader — the wrong-party-leader defect again, and this time across the political divide |
| PP-227 | **S1** | `inPower` / `inExecutive` | three parties in power, **none in the executive** | **SVP, SP, FDP and The Centre in the executive**; the other six out of power | The Federal Council is a permanent grand coalition holding 2–2–2–1 under the 1959 Zauberformel |
| PP-228 | **S2** | `seats` | SP **43**, FDP **29** | **41**, **28** | The National Council's own composition after the 22 October 2023 election |
| PP-229 | **S3** | coverage | 3 parties, 134 of 200 | **10 parties, 200 of 200 exactly** | Seven seated parties were absent, including **The Centre (29)**, a governing party, and the **Greens (23)** |
| PP-230 | **S3** | coalitions | none | **`CH-FC`** (the Federal Council, 4 parties, 7 seats) | Recorded with a note that this is *not* a government formed after an election |
| PP-231 | **S6** | `positionRaw` | SVP "Right-wing"; SP "Centre-left"; FDP "Centre-right" | each party's cited position verbatim (SVP **"Right-wing to far-right"**, FDP **"Centre to centre-right"**) | Flattened ranges restored |

**Switzerland's `inPower` means something different, and the coalition entry says so.** Everywhere
else in this dataset a governing coalition is formed after an election and falls with it. The Federal
Council is a standing, voluntary grand coalition of the four largest parties that does not change when
the National Council does, so `timeInPower` records the concordance rather than a date, and `CH-FC`
carries a note explaining it. Modelling it as an ordinary cabinet would misstate how the country works.

**The Evangelical People's Party is `other`**, like Ireland's Aontú: its own cited position is two
positions, *"Economic: centre to centre-left; social: centre-right"*, not a range.

**One honest gap.** The **Ticino League** has no bundled emblem: Commons holds no logo file for it (a
namespace-6 search returns only seating diagrams), its article's infobox carries no `logo` parameter
at all, and Wikidata records no P154 image on its item under Switzerland. Listed with a
`noImageReason` rather than dropped — and rather than shown a canton flag it does not own.

**Documented gap — none on seats.** Switzerland is the **ninth country in this sweep to reconcile
exactly**. Seven logos are on Commons; two (the Greens and the EVP) are non-free files on English
Wikipedia and are declared. All nine were montage-verified.

### 🇦🇹 Austria — audited 2026-09-12

Austria had **two** parties, and the one that won the election was recorded with **zero seats**.
`AT-FPOE` carried `seats: 0` while the Freedom Party is the **largest single party in the National
Council with 57** — the starkest instance yet of defect **B3**, the zero-seat entries the baseline
survey counted. A reader opening Austria saw a two-party country in which the winner did not appear
to hold a seat.

The National Council, 183 seats: **Government (Stocker) 109** — ÖVP 51, SPÖ 41, NEOS 17 —
**Opposition 74** — FPÖ 57, Greens 16, one independent.

| ID | Sev | Field | Was | Now | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| PP-233 | **S3** | coverage | 2 parties, 41 of 183 | **5 parties, 182 of 183** | Three seated parties were absent, including the **ÖVP (51)**, which holds the chancellorship |
| PP-234 | **S2** | `inPower` / `inExecutive` | SPÖ in power, `inExecutive` absent | **ÖVP, SPÖ and NEOS in the executive**; FPÖ and the Greens out | The Stocker government, formed 3 March 2025 |
| PP-235 | **S2** | `leaderTitle` | absent | **Chairman** (FPÖ, SPÖ), **Chairperson** (ÖVP), **Chairwoman** (NEOS), **Spokeswoman** (Greens) | Each party's own infobox |
| PP-236 | **S3** | coalitions | none | **`AT-GOV`** (Stocker, 109 of 183) | Austria's first three-party federal coalition |
| PP-237 | **S4** | logo hygiene | `at/` held three broken files and three stray `.sha256` texts | directory rebuilt with five verified logos | The broken files were cleared in the cross-country sweep below; the directory is now exactly the five parties |

**Why the election's winner sits in opposition** is recorded in the coalition's note, because the
data alone reads as a contradiction: the ÖVP–FPÖ talks collapsed, and the ÖVP then formed Austria's
first three-party federal coalition with the SPÖ and NEOS instead.

**Documented gap — 1 of the 183 seats**: a single independent member, correctly not modelled as a
party.

All five logos are public domain on Commons and were montage-verified.

### 🌍 Cross-country: 104 party logos were not images at all — 2026-09-12

Found while auditing Ireland, whose three logo files turned out to be Wikimedia error pages
(**PP-199**). Sweeping the class, as the repo's own rule requires, found the same defect on a scale
no single country's audit would have surfaced.

**104 of 619 bundled files were not images.** 101 were Wikimedia "page not found" **HTML** saved
under an `.svg` extension; three were the media CDN's plain-text
`File not found: /v1/AUTH_mw/…` body. They covered **33 countries** — for every one of them, *every
party card in the grid was a broken image in production*.

| | |
|---|---|
| Countries affected | AD AE AF AG AL AM AO AT AZ BA BB BE BF BG BH BI BJ BS BT BW BZ CM CR CZ DZ EE FI GE HU IE IL IS LT LU MT RO |
| Party entries showing a broken image | **104** |
| Recorded `logoSourceUrl`s pointing at a Commons file **that does not exist** | **97 of 101** |
| Orphan broken files, referenced by nothing | 4 (`at/fpo.svg`, `at/oevp.svg`, `at/spo.svg`, `be/mr.svg`) |
| Stray `.sha256` text files shipping as part of the site | 6 (`at/`, `be/`) |

**The root cause was a fabricated citation, not a sourcing impossibility.** The filenames were
invented from a plausible pattern — `Barbados_Labour_Party_logo.svg`, `FLN_Algeria_logo.svg`,
`Bhutan_Kuen_Nyam_Party_logo.svg` — rather than read off the party's own article. The fetch wrote
the 404 body to disk and the entry recorded *its* sha256, so **every existing check passed**: the
path existed, the bytes hashed, the URL looked right. A sha256 proves a file has not *changed*; it
can never prove it was ever right. And the real files mostly existed — Barbados Labour Party's logo
is `Barbados Labour Party logo.png`, the same stem under a different extension.

| ID | Sev | What | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| PP-215 | **S1** | 101 logos were HTML error pages; 3 were plain-text CDN 404 bodies | Read the bundled bytes: they begin `<!DOCTYPE html>` / `File not found: /v1/AUTH_mw/…` |
| PP-216 | **S1** | 97 of 101 recorded `logoSourceUrl`s resolve to a **missing** Commons/Wikipedia file page | Queried each one's `action=query&prop=imageinfo`; only 4 returned an image |
| PP-217 | **S2** | 4 Indian logos were **PNG data under a `.svg` extension** (`in/bjp`, `in/inc`, `in/dmk`, `in/tmc`) | Magic-number sniff; files renamed to `.png` and the entries re-pointed |
| PP-218 | **S4** | 4 orphan broken files and 6 stray `.sha256` text files shipping to users | Same hygiene defect already fixed in Chile, Colombia, the Netherlands and Denmark |
| PP-219 | **S1** | **The gate could not see any of it.** `check-political-parties.mjs` now sniffs the bytes | `imageKind()` fails the build on HTML, on an unrecognisable body, and on image data contradicting its extension |

**83 of the 104 were re-sourced and montage-verified**; the other 21 became honest
`noImageReason` gaps. Resolution ran in three passes, each stricter than the last:

1. **Wikidata, constrained by P17 (country), exact name/alias match only** — 40 hits. Fuzzy matches
   were discarded, the discipline that removed every collision in the 2026-09-12 backfill.
2. **The party's own English Wikipedia article**, accepted only when the infobox `country` matched
   *and* the article's title or infobox name matched the party's own name — 29 more.
3. **A hand-curated title list** for parties whose stored `nameEn` differs from their article title
   (Finland's "National Coalition" → *National Coalition Party*, Afghanistan's "Islamic Society of
   Afghanistan" → *Jamiat-e Islami*) — 15 more, minus two rejected below.

**A first attempt at pass 2 silently resolved nothing** because its country guard compared against
`COUNTRY_FACTS`, which carries `nameOfficial` but no common name: every comparison fell back to the
ISO code and rejected every correct hit. Worth recording because it failed *quietly* — 0 matches
reads exactly like "no logos exist".

**Three picks were rejected on identity, two of them only by eye.** The montage is what caught the
first; the other two were caught by comparing names:

- **Georgia's Coalition for Change** resolved to `Ahali Party Logo.svg` — the logo of one **member**
  party. The article's infobox carries it, so every mechanical check passed; bundling it would have
  captioned Ahali's emblem as the alliance's. Left as a gap, with that reason recorded in the entry.
- **Antigua's "Democratic Movement for Change"** resolved to the *Democratic National Alliance* (DNA)
  and **Andorra's "Democratic Party of Andorra"** to *Democrats for Andorra* (DA). Near-miss
  identities, which is the wrong-logo class this sweep exists to remove. Both left as gaps.

**A tooling bug this pass created and fixed.** `patch.mjs` located a country block's end by scanning
for a `"\n  ],\n"` line — but some blocks in this file end with the next country opening on the
**same** line (`  ],  "AD": [`). The scan skipped past it and **deleted the whole of Andorra**. It
now finds the closing bracket by counting brackets, ignoring those inside strings.

Coverage after this pass: **531 parties carry a real, verified logo; 42 carry an honest gap.**
