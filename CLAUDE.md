# Hana's Flag Game — development guide

## Flag aspect ratios — hard rule, do not override without approval

Every national and territory flag SVG in `public/flags/` is sourced from
[hampusborgos/country-flags](https://github.com/hampusborgos/country-flags)
and encodes the **real-world aspect ratio** in its `viewBox`:

| Flag | viewBox | Ratio |
|------|---------|-------|
| France, most of Africa/Americas | `0 0 3 2` | 3:2 |
| Germany, Austria, Belgium | `0 0 5 3` | 5:3 |
| UK, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji | `0 0 60 30` | 2:1 |
| Switzerland, Vatican City | `0 0 32 32` | 1:1 |
| Qatar | `0 0 1400 550` | ~28:11 |
| Nepal | negative-origin viewBox | pentagon |
| Afghanistan | `0 0 1000 500` | 2:1 (Wikimedia override) |

### Rules — apply to all code changes, CSS, and flag downloads

1. **Never** add `aspect-ratio` to `.flag-card`, `.flag-grid__thumb`,
   `.flag-image`, or any other element that wraps a flag, in a way that
   overrides the SVG's natural proportions.

2. **Never** use `object-fit: cover` on flag `<img>` elements — it crops
   flags. Always use `object-fit: contain`.

3. **Never** download national/territory flags from `flagcdn.com` or the
   `flag-icons` npm package. These standardise every flag to `640×480` (4:3),
   destroying the real-world proportions. The correct source is
   `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hampusborgos/country-flags/main/svg/{code}.svg`.

4. **Afghanistan exception**: `public/flags/af.svg` uses the Taliban / Islamic
   Emirate flag from Wikimedia Commons (pinned in `NATIONAL_SOURCE_OVERRIDES`
   in `scripts/download-flags.mjs`). Do not replace it with the hampusborgos
   file — that repo carries the pre-2021 Republic flag for `AF`.

### Enforcement

`npm run flags:check` (and the `flag-integrity` CI workflow) fail if any
bundled SVG has a forbidden standardised viewBox. Any PR that touches
`public/flags/` must pass this check.

To re-download all flags correctly:
```
node scripts/download-flags.mjs --force --national-only
```

## Disputed territory neutrality — hard rule, do not override without approval

When two or more nations claim or dispute a subnational territory, the game takes no side.
The rules below are **hard-coded** and must be preserved in all future changes.

### World map view

Clicking on a disputed/claimed territory on the world map **must never select or highlight any nation**.
The mechanism: `DISPUTED_TERRITORY_CODES` (auto-derived in `src/lib/territoryParentMap.ts`) lists all
disputed geo codes. `UNDISPUTED_TERRITORY_PARENT` excludes them. The world map receives only
`UNDISPUTED_TERRITORY_PARENT`, making disputed polygons non-clickable.
**Always pass `UNDISPUTED_TERRITORY_PARENT`, never the full `TERRITORY_PARENT`, to the world map.**

### Nation subnational view — flag grid

When browsing a nation's subnational divisions, disputed/claimed territories **are** shown — but only
with a flag if the parent nation officially recognises one.

| Territory | Under UK (administers) | Under Argentina (claims) |
|-----------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Falkland Islands / Malvinas | Shown with FK flag ✓ | No flag shown (Argentina has no recognised flag for it) |

**Never** add a flag URL for a claimed entry (`AR-ML~`, `ES-GIB~`, etc.) under the claiming nation unless
that nation officially recognises a distinct flag for the territory.

### Hierarchy rule — most important

A claimed/disputed territory **must respect the political hierarchy of its parent nation**.
If the claiming nation groups the territory as part of an existing administrative division,
the territory **must not appear as a standalone entity in the flag grid**.
Instead, clicking its landmass on the subdivision map must redirect to the parent subdivision.

This is implemented via `DISPUTED_TERRITORY_HIERARCHY` in `src/lib/disputedSubdivisions.ts`:

| Claimed code | Hierarchy parent | Rationale |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------|
| `AR-ML~` | `AR-V` (Tierra del Fuego) | Argentine constitution places Malvinas inside the Province of Tierra del Fuego |
| `ES-GIB~` | `ES-CA` (Cádiz) | Spanish administrative law places Gibraltar in the Province of Cádiz |
| `IN-AK~` | `IN-JK` (Jammu & Kashmir UT) | India's Instrument of Accession covers all of J&K, including Azad Kashmir |
| `IN-GB~` | `IN-LA` (Ladakh UT) | India's 2019 reorganisation places this border area in Ladakh |

Any new disputed entry must declare a `DISPUTED_TERRITORY_HIERARCHY` parent **unless** the claiming nation
treats the territory as a standalone entity (e.g. Turkey → TRNC, Cyprus → Northern Cyprus, Ukraine → Crimea).

The **administering** nation (e.g. UK for Falklands and Gibraltar) always shows the territory as its own
standalone division with its recognised flag.

### Enforcement

`src/lib/disputedSubdivisions.ts` contains `DISPUTED_TERRITORY_HIERARCHY` and `DISPUTED_HIERARCHY_CHILDREN_OF`.
`SubdivisionFlagGrid` filters out hierarchy children from the visible grid.
`SubdivisionMap` redirects clicks on hierarchy children to their parent subdivision code, and highlights
child polygons when their parent is selected.
`useSubdivisionGame` excludes hierarchy children from game questions.

## PR workflow — hard rule for all agents

After pushing a branch and creating a pull request, an agent **MUST**:

1. **Immediately merge** the PR (squash merge) — do not leave it open waiting for manual action unless the user has explicitly asked to review first.
2. **Confirm the merge succeeded** by checking the merge response.
3. **Report back** with:
   - Merge status (success/failure)
   - Current time in **AEST** (Australian Eastern Standard Time, UTC+10; or AEDT UTC+11 during daylight saving, which runs October–April)
   - The merge commit SHA (this is the build code/number)

Example confirmation message format:
> Merged ✓ — commit `b05323a` — 9:56 PM AEST

Do not report the time in UTC or any other timezone unless asked.
