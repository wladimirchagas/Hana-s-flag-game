/**
 * Era catalogue for the Learn-mode time slider.
 *
 * Historical eras load hand-curated GeoJSON files from the
 * aourednik/historical-basemaps dataset (mirrored in /public/historical-maps).
 * Each file is a FeatureCollection whose features represent actual
 * historical polities of that era (Roman Empire, Mongol Empire, etc.) with
 * their borders as they were — NOT modern country outlines.
 *
 * Each polity's display name comes from the GeoJSON's `NAME` property. The
 * POLITY_REGISTRY below maps a subset of those names to flag images and
 * editorial notes. Polities not in the registry still appear on the map
 * and get a sensible fallback in the detail panel (name only, no flag).
 *
 * "Today" is the one exception — it keeps the modern world-atlas TopoJSON
 * + flagcdn flags so the page still answers "what does the world look like
 * right now?" without any historical-data caveats.

  // traditions. They are the largest features on every ancient map (a single entry
  // here covers 8–13 era slots), and they rendered as bare words. Each note below
