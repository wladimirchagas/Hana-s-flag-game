/**
 * IOC basis for the world-map grid's "Olympic committees" view.
 *
 * That view (and ONLY that view — flags / arms / passports / football crests
 * stay on the 195 UN members) is drawn from the IOC's 206 current National
 * Olympic Committees instead. Mirrors `fifaAssociations.ts` exactly:
 *
 *   • Game members that hold NO NOC are hidden (NON_IOC_GRID_CODES) — today
 *     that is Vatican City alone, which the National symbols tab already
 *     shows as an honest "no NOC" entry rather than a fabricated one.
 *   • Twelve non-UN territories the IOC recognises as their own NOC (Hong
 *     Kong, Chinese Taipei, Puerto Rico, Aruba, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands,
 *     the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Cook
 *     Islands, and Kosovo) are appended as their own logo card (IOC_EXTRA).
 *     Every one is a territory the game already carries as a special-status
 *     entity — the same set of codes FIFA_EXTRA uses for football, minus the
 *     entities that hold FIFA membership but no IOC one (Macau, the Faroe
 *     Islands, Gibraltar, Anguilla, Montserrat, Turks and Caicos, Curaçao,
 *     New Caledonia, Tahiti — none of which fields its own Olympic team).
 *
 * 194 UN-member NOCs (the 195 minus Vatican) + 12 IOC_EXTRA entities = the
 * IOC's own published count of 206 current NOCs (2026).
 *
 * Each added card carries its OWN continent (not the parent's), and selecting
 * it opens the parent country, whose National symbols tab shows that
 * entity's logo. Kosovo has no parent entity, so its card is informational.
