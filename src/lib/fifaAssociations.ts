/**
 * FIFA basis for the world-map grid's "Football associations" view.
 *
 * That view (and ONLY that view — flags / arms / passports stay on the 195 UN
 * members) is drawn from FIFA's ~211 member associations instead:
 *
 *   • Game members that are NOT FIFA members are hidden (NON_FIFA_GRID_CODES) —
 *     the Pacific micro-states with no FIFA/OFC full membership, Monaco and the
 *     Vatican. They have no FIFA crest, so they do not belong in a FIFA grid.
 *   • The UK is expanded into its four home nations (handled in FlagGrid via
 *     subnationalFootballCrests()).
 *   • Every non-UN FIFA member the game already models as a sub-national ENTITY
 *     (Hong Kong, Faroe Islands, Gibraltar, the Caribbean and Pacific
 *     associations, …) plus Kosovo is added as its own crest card (FIFA_EXTRA).
 *
 * Each added card carries its OWN continent (not the parent's — New Caledonia and
 * Tahiti are Oceania though France is Europe), and selecting it opens the parent
 * country, whose National symbols tab shows that entity's crest. Kosovo has no
 * parent entity, so its card is informational.
