/**
 * Sourced city-flag-meaning explanations for the Learn-mode capital-city widget.
 *
 * Rendered by `src/components/FlagMeaning.tsx` (the SAME progressive-disclosure
 * "What this flag means" component the national/subnational flags use, so the
 * look, font, spacing and behaviour are identical) below the capital city's flag
 * in `src/components/CapitalDetails.tsx`.
 *
 * Keyed by the ISO 3166-2 subdivision code whose CAPITAL city the flag belongs
 * to — the same key `CAPITAL_FLAGS` / `CAPITAL_DETAILS` use — because the widget
 * shows a subdivision's capital-city flag. City flags are a distinct category
 * from national/subnational flags (exactly like the capital-flag files), so they
 * live in their own dataset rather than in `flagMeanings.ts`.
 *
 * HARD RULE — see "Flag-meaning explanations must be sourced and must separate
 * myth from fact" in CLAUDE.md. Every entry:
 *   - describes the flag's design + DOCUMENTED symbolism only (never invented,
 *     paraphrased-to-fill, or machine-generated), and
 *   - carries at least one authoritative `sources` citation with a real URL, and
 *   - places any widely-believed-but-false / folk-etymology / disputed claim in
 *     `myths` (claim + sourced reality) so it is shown as myth, NOT as fact.
 *
 * An entry MUST only describe the flag the widget actually shows for that code
 * (the bundled `public/capital-flags/*` file); never describe a variant the app
 * does not display.
 *
 * `scripts/check-city-flag-meanings.mjs` (run by `npm run flags:check` + CI)
 * fails the build if an entry has no description, no source, a source without a
 * valid http(s) URL, or a malformed myth. The check is a safety net, not a
 * substitute for verifying each claim against the cited source by hand.
 *
 * Coverage is an incrementally-growing curated set — a capital whose code has no
 * entry simply renders no disclosure.
