/**
 * National tourism-board logos for Learn mode.
 *
 * Shown both in the world-map grid's "Show" dropdown (one card per country) and
 * as a "Tourism" section in each country's National symbols tab, following the
 * same pattern as Commercial airlines / Public broadcasters (see
 * `src/lib/tourismLogos.ts`, `FlagGrid.tsx`, `NationalFlagGrid.tsx`).
 *
 * Every entry's logo is the OFFICIAL national tourism-board / destination-
 * marketing logo — the mark the country's own tourism promotion body uses, not
 * a generic government seal or an unrelated brand. Where no authoritative image
 * could be sourced after an exhaustive search, the entry carries `noImageReason`
 * instead of a fabricated logo (never invented — same discipline as every other
 * flag/logo/crest in this repo).
 *
 * `visitors` is the one comparable data point requested across every country: the
 * most recent authoritative annual visitor figure, always paired with its exact
 * `metric` so two entries are never implied to be more comparable than they
 * really are (a country's "international tourist arrivals" total is not the same
 * measurement as, say, a single museum's visitor count). Where no authoritative
 * figure could be sourced, `visitorsNote` documents the gap honestly instead of
 * approximating one.
 *
 * Coverage is a growing set — see CLAUDE.md's football-crest/political-party
 * sweeps for the discipline this collection follows: source properly, never pad.
