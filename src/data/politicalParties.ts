/**
 * Sourced political-party data for the Learn-mode "Political parties" grid view
 * and its detail widget.
 *
 * HARD RULE — same discipline as every other sourced dataset in this repo (see
 * CLAUDE.md "Never invent or approximate" rules): every fact here — the party's
 * name, ideology, founding year, leader, coalition membership, seat count — MUST
 * come from an authoritative, cited source (`sources`). Nothing is guessed or
 * paraphrased-to-fill. A field with no sourceable value is OMITTED, never
 * invented — a party with no listed leader is honest; a guessed one is not.
 *
 * SCOPE — per owner direction (2026-09): only parties currently holding at least
 * one seat in the country's national lower/unicameral legislative chamber are
 * included. A country with no competitive multi-party system (an absolute
 * monarchy, a one-party state) is either omitted entirely or — where a single
 * ruling party genuinely exists — represented by that one party; this dataset
 * currently only covers competitive multi-party systems.
 *
 * COVERAGE is an incrementally-growing curated set, exactly like
 * `flagMeanings.ts` — hand-authored, sourced country by country, never
 * generated. Do not pad an omission; do not fabricate to complete a country.
 *
 * Logo images are bundled locally under `public/party-logos/{cc}/` (never a
 * runtime URL — same "all flag/symbol files must be bundled" discipline as
 * every other image in this game). A party logo that cannot be freely licensed
 * on Wikimedia Commons is still bundled non-free (fair-use) with a `licenceNote`
 * documenting the copyright position — the same pattern already used for
 * football-association crests and passport covers.
 *
 * `scripts/check-political-parties.mjs` (run by `npm run flags:check`)
 * validates structure (sourcing, bundled/checksummed logos, seat-count sanity,
 * coalition-reference integrity) — it is a safety net, not a substitute for
 * verifying each claim against its cited source by hand.

The design directly inspired Kenya's national flag (the same black-red-green bands), though the cockerel itself was replaced by the Maasai shield and crossed spears on the national flag at independence.",

        "description": "DAP's rocket logo has been used since the 1969 general election. The red rocket symbolises the party's aspiration for a modern, dynamic and progressive society; the four rocket boosters represent the support and drive given to the party's objectives by the three major ethnic groups (Malay, Chinese, Indian) and others; the blue circle stands for the unity of Malaysia's multiracial people; and the white background stands for purity and incorruptibility.",
