/**
 * Renders an era-specific historical world map.
 *
 * Unlike WorldProgressMap (which always uses the modern world-atlas
 * TopoJSON), this component loads a GeoJSON FeatureCollection from the
 * hand-curated aourednik/historical-basemaps dataset. Each feature is an
 * actual historical polity with its borders as they were at the chosen
 * date — Roman Empire including Roman Britain, Mongol Empire as one
 * contiguous shape, etc.
 *
 * Selection is keyed by the feature's `NAME` property (not ISO codes).
 * Hovering a polity reports its name; clicking it selects it. Multiple
 * polygons that share a NAME (e.g., an empire with detached territories)
 * all highlight together when any one is selected.
 *
 * Performance note: the historical GeoJSON files are large (1–14 MB).
 * Path computation is expensive, so this component is memoised and its
 * centerLongitude prop intentionally excludes the rotation animation
 * offset — only the user's chosen base meridian is used. That keeps path
 * recomputation to a minimum (only on data load or explicit preset change)
 * while the modern globe spins freely next to it.

 * The two datasets draw the same coast at different resolutions: the era files
 * carry a polity's outline in tens of points where Natural Earth 50m uses
 * hundreds (1945's Philippines: 279 points against 1,238). Wherever the era
 * polygon cuts a corner, the coastline layer underneath shows through as a
 * hatched sliver — and because that hatch is the "no polity here" fill, a
 * polity ends up wearing a ragged shadow of unclaimed land along its own coast.
 * That shipped and was reported (2026-08) as "wrong, unselectable territories
 * that look like a shadow" on the 1945 Philippines. Measured across every era at
 * this projection's own scale, the land no feature covers is ~1.7% of all land

 * mismatch, not missing data — while the genuinely unmapped land (islands the era
 * file simply does not carry) sits far outside this tolerance: in 1945, ~170
 * pixels lie more than 8 units from anything, and those keep their hatch.
 *

 * instead of hatched. The value is in USER space, not screen pixels, so the
 * reconciliation holds at every zoom level — the mismatch it hides is a fixed
 * distance on the ground, and a screen-space fix would unravel the moment the
 * user zoomed in (which is exactly how the bug was reported).
